<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>To the jealousy of Francisco Pizarro was
due the discovery and conquest of Chile. Reports
having reached Pizarro that there were
regions to the south yet virgin, and teeming
with wealth richer than that of Peru, he sent
Diego de Almagro, one of his lieutenants, with
an expedition to conquer these unknown lands.
Almagro failed, and later he sent Pedro de
Valdivia with another expedition. There was
another reason for sending these expeditions,
for Pizarro hoped that neither of these men
would return to Peru, since he feared their
shrewdness and popularity.</p>

<p>Valdivia succeeded in establishing a permanent
settlement, but himself fell a victim to
the hardy tribesmen of the central valley of
Chile, who were far different from the soft and
mild Incas enslaved by Pizarro. He had found
that it was no easy task he had undertaken,
and the sturdy race of Araucanians was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
unconquered when the Spaniards were driven
out of the country by the generations that had
grown up from the time of its first settlement.</p>

<p>The Chileans have ever been independent in
thought and action, and they have proved to
be the best soldiers of South America. The
temperate climate, the mountainous character
of the country and its isolation, and the admixture
of blood with the unconquerable Araucanians,
who most nearly resemble the North
American redmen of any of the aborigines of
South America, have all contributed to the development
of this characteristic.</p>

<p>The government is now as stable and hopeful
as that of any of the South American nations,
and, because of its natural formation, Chile has
developed into the strongest maritime nation
of that continent. Its fine bays and harbours,
its coal supplies and its long seacoast, undoubtedly
destine Chile to be the master of the
southern seas in the ages yet to come. Furthermore,
its vast and fertile valleys, where
every product of the temperate climate grows,
and where immense herds of cattle may be fed,
its mineral wealth and vast nitrate fields, undoubtedly
destine it to a greatness on land as
well as on the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Chile has always appealed to
the writer, in common with thousands of other
people, and it has been a pleasure to trace the
development of the country from its incipiency
to its present condition. The same care has
been exercised in the preparation of “Chile
and Her People of To-day” as in the other
books of the series, which have been so well
received. Any repetitions that appear of expressions
or ideas are intentional and not the
result of hasty or careless preparation.</p>

<p>The author wishes to acknowledge his obligation
to The Pan-American Bulletin for two
or three photographs which appear in this
work, and also to the Bureau under which it
is issued for many courtesies received at the
hands of the Director and his associates.</p>

<h1>CHILE AND HER PEOPLE OF TO-DAY</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE COUNTRY</span></h2>

<p>The republic of Chile has one of the strangest
configurations of any country on the globe.
It stretches over thirty-eight degrees of latitude,
thus giving it a coast line of twenty-six
hundred and twenty-five miles from its northern
border to the most southerly point on the
Fuegian Archipelago. It is a long and narrow
ribbon of land, at no place wider than two hundred
miles, and in places narrowing to sixty-five
miles. It has an average width of only
ninety miles, while the length is fully thirty
times the average width. Placed on the western
coast of North America, in the corresponding
latitude, this republic would extend from
Sitka, Alaska, to a point on the Pacific coast
opposite the City of Mexico. If the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Texas should be stretched out into a narrow
strip of land two thousand and five hundred
miles in length, it would give a fair idea of
the peculiar shape of Chile. It follows quite
closely the seventieth parallel of longitude,
which would correspond with that of Boston.
This strange development has been due to the
Andean mountain range, which, with its lofty
peaks and numberless spurs, forms the eastern
boundary throughout its entire length. For a
long time the boundary lines with its neighbours
were in dispute, but these have all been
successfully adjusted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus2">
<a href="images/map.jpg"><img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="100" height="475" alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><b>Transcriber’s Note:</b> The map is clickable for
a larger version, if the device you’re reading this on supports that.</p>
</div>

<p>Within these boundaries there is naturally a
wide divergence of climate. In the north, at
sea level, the vegetation is tropical, and it is
semi-tropical for several hundred miles south.
If one goes inland the mountains are soon
encountered, and the line of perpetual snow is
reached at about fifteen thousand feet, but this
line descends as you proceed south. On the
Fuegian Islands snow seldom disappears from
sight, although at sea level it may all thaw.
The temperature everywhere varies according
to altitude and proximity to the sea. In the
north it is milder than the same latitude on the
eastern coast, because of the Antarctic Current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which washes the shores, and at the south it is
warmer than the same latitude in North America.
Within these extremes, from the regions
which are washed by the Antarctic seas to the
banks of the Sama River, which separates it
from Peru, and between the shores where the
Pacific breakers roll and the Cordilleras of the
Andes which mark the boundary with Argentina,
there are two hundred and ninety-one
thousand, five hundred square miles, and supporting
a population of three and a quarter
millions of people, of many shades of colour.</p>

<p>One-fourth or more of the territory of Chile
is made up of islands. The largest of these,
of course, is Tierra del Fuego, of which a little
more than one-half is Chilean territory. The
coast from Puerto Montt to the southern limits
of the continent is notched and indented with
fiords and inlets, and scores of islands have
been formed, probably by volcanic action.
Few of these have claimed any attention, and,
of all those lashed by the waves of the Antarctic
seas, Tierra del Fuego is the only one that
has received any development. The sheep man
has taken possession of portions of that island,
and hundreds of thousands of sheep now graze
on its succulent grasses. The island of Chiloé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
near Puerto Montt, is one of the most important
of the islands, and several small foreign
colonies have been located on its rich soil.
Some of the islands are very remote from the
mainland. The most isolated one is Pascua,
or Easter, island, which is at a distance of
more than two thousand miles from the coast.
It is almost in the centre of the Pacific Ocean.
The San Felix and San Ambrosio groups, and
that of Juan Fernandez, the reputed home of
Robinson Crusoe, are also at a distance of several
hundred miles from the shores of the republic.</p>

<p>From the northern boundary to Concepción,
the coast line is generally uniform and indentations
are rare. There are only a few bays
of any considerable size, and only an occasional
cape or promontory. From Chiloé to Tierra
del Fuego is a stretch of coast five hundred
miles in length, which a glance at the map will
show is a perfect network of islands, peninsulas
and channels. This is the Chilean Patagonia.
It provides scenery as grandly picturesque
as the famous fiords along the coast of
Norway, and greatly resembles that broken
and rugged coast. The bays and gulfs cut
into the shores to the foothills of the Andean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
range. They are of great depth. The Gulf of
Las Peñas furnishes an entrance to this labyrinth
at the north, and the Straits of Magellan
at the south. Some of the passes are so narrow
that they seem like gigantic splits in the
mountain ranges—grandly gloomy and narrow.
Through these openings in the rock the
water rushes with terrific force owing to the
action of the tides. But, once within, the opening
broadens out into little bays, where the
waters are as calm and serene as a mountain
lake. These channels are a vast Campo Santo,
or God’s Acre, of wrecked vessels. Numerous
as the disasters have been the sight of a
stranded boat is rare, for the grave is usually
hundreds of fathoms deep. In every case, however,
the wrecked vessel has given her name to
the rock that brought disaster, and the official
charts are dotted with the names of rocks,
which thus form eternal headstones for the
unfortunate vessels. One writer has given the
following account of these channels:—</p>

<p>“If one can imagine the Hudson River
bordered continuously by verdure-covered
mountains descending precipitously into the
water, and jutting out here and there in fantastic
buttress-like headlands, one has some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
idea of Messier Channel. But add to this a
network of long, thin cataracts threading their
way thousands of feet down through gullies
and alleys from mountain crest to water edge.
Far up the mountain sides they are so distant
as to seem motionless, like threads of silver
beaten into the crevices of the rocks; but near
the water their motion can be both seen and
heard as they fall amid the rocks to reach the
sea.”</p>

<p>The southern portion of the republic terminates
in two peninsulas, known as King William
and Brunswick, which are separated by
the gulfs of Otway and Skyring. The Straits
of Magellan then separate the mainland from
the Fuegian Archipelago. This channel, which
varies in width from one to twenty-five miles,
is three hundred and sixty-two miles in length
from Cape Pillar to Cape Virgenes, the latter
being the eastern, or Atlantic, terminus. It
affords a safe passage for vessels, and is used
almost exclusively by steamers bound from one
coast to the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ANDES FROM SANTA LUCIA.</p>
</div>

<p>After forming the plateau of Bolivia, the
Andes, the backbone of South America,
stretches down to the lower end of the continent.
It is formed by a succession of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mountains, with lofty peaks covered with the
eternal snows. At intervals passes are found
which permit of access from one side of the
mountain to another. The highest point of this
mighty range is reached just opposite Valparaiso,
Mt. Aconcagua, and from there it descends
until, at the Straits of Magellan, it
reaches sea level. It probably continues still
farther, but its highest spurs are engulfed beneath
the ocean. The width also varies
greatly, from forty-five to one hundred miles.
Along the Chilean border there are more than
fifty definite peaks exceeding thirty-three hundred
feet in height, and twenty-nine of more
than ten thousand feet in altitude. Four are
above twenty thousand feet. Most of these
were originally volcanoes, but they are nearly
all now extinct or quiescent. South of Aconcagua
is a succession of lofty volcanic peaks,
such as San José de Maipu, San Fernando,
Tingueririca and others, all apparently extinct.
Then follow Nevado del Chillan, Antuco, Villarica
and Osorno, all of which occasionally
emit vapour, and, lastly, the Tronador (thunderer)
near the southern extremity of the country.</p>

<p>By reason of its peculiar shape easy access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is given to all parts of the republic, and the
exploitation of its resources has been comparatively
easy. In no place are the mountains
far distant, and short spurs of railway connect
the mineral deposits with the sea. Along the
coast there are no fewer than fifty-nine ports,
between which regular communication by
steamer is carried on. Fourteen of these are
ports of entry, in which customs houses are
located, and the others are minor ports, at
which only national coasting steamers stop.</p>

<p>There are very many rivers in the country,
but only a very few of them are any aid to
navigation. They are mostly short streams
which are formed by the melting snows of the
Andes, and then rush onward toward the sea
by a more or less direct route. The principal
rivers are all in the southern half of the country.
In the deserts of the northern section the
waters formed by melting snows are evaporated
or are absorbed by the parched soil long
before they reach the sea. The Yelcho and
Palena are the largest rivers of Chile. The
latter is the longest, for it cuts through a pass
in the Andes and runs back into Argentine territory
for seventy-five miles. Others are the
Maullin, Calle-Calle, Bio-Bio, Bueno and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Maule. Some, such as the Bio-Bio and Maule,
are navigable for short distances by vessels of
shallow draft. Their importance to commerce
is insignificant, however, when compared with
the great rivers of the eastern coast. The Bio-Bio,
for instance, is only one hundred and sixty
miles long. They do furnish water for irrigation
purposes, only a small portion of which
has as yet been developed. There are several
lakes in Chile, of which Llanquihue, Todos
Santos, and Ranco are the most important.
The two first mentioned have steam navigation.</p>

<p>There are many valleys of very fertile land
which can be made among the richest agricultural
lands of the world. As a rule these valleys
are small and irrigated by streams flowing
from the east to the west. The great central
valley, which runs in a southerly direction for
several hundred miles from Santiago, is one
of the most remarkable features of the country
and the garden of the republic. This valley
is almost six hundred miles in length from
north to south, but varies considerably in
width. Its average width for the entire length
is probably thirty miles. This is the granary
of the country, and the source of its principal
food supply. All of the cereals grow to perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in this climate and on this soil. Wheat,
barley, corn, rye and oats are cultivated in
large quantities. All of the vegetables and
fruits that flourish in the temperate zone of the
Northern Hemisphere also grow to large size.
Alfalfa makes a fine pasture. And yet even
this fertile valley has only been developed in
part. Not more than one-fourth of the landed
surface of Chile is fitted for cultivation, but
of this portion not more than one-fourth has
been touched by the agriculturist or ranchman.
Hence there are great possibilities of development
yet unexploited in this republic. Cattle
and sheep are profitable and are increasing in
number. The waterfalls, also, give great possibilities
of cheap power for manufacturing
purposes, and the future will probably find all
of the railroads operated by electric power,
because of the cheapness with which current
can be produced. This result seems to be only
the natural outcome of existing conditions.</p>

<p>Such a country, with such a long extent of
sea coast, would ordinarily be an almost impossible
country to handle. It has, perhaps, been
fortunate that the coast is easily reached in
all parts, from the inhospitable deserts of the
northern regions to the dense forests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
south. No country of equal size in the world
has such a marvellously varied configuration.
The humming-bird follows the fuchsia clear to
the Straits of Magellan, and the penguin has
followed the fish almost as far as Valparaiso.
The government has done well in managing
this ribbon-like country. Coast service has
been built up and a longitudinal railway promises
an interior development. Cross lines and
transcontinental routes will provide much
needed facilities for the interchange of commerce.
The telegraph and telephone have
linked together hitherto remote sections, and
a creditable postal service has been created.</p>

<p>Chile is a republic, with the customary division
into legislative, executive and judicial
branches. It is not a confederation of provinces,
as in Brazil and Argentina, but is a
single state with one central government. It
is divided for governmental purposes into
twenty-three provinces and one territory.
These are again divided into departments, districts
and municipalities. Congress is composed
of a Senate and Chamber of Deputies.
The former is at present composed of thirty-two
members and the latter of ninety-four.
Deputies are elected for a term of three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by direct vote, in the proportion of one to every
thirty thousand inhabitants. Senators are
elected for six years in the proportion of one
to every three deputies, and the terms of one-third
expire every two years. Members of the
House of Deputies must have an income of
five hundred dollars a year, and a Senator
must be thirty-six years of age and is required
to have an annual income four times that sum.
Congress sits from June 1 to September 1
each year, but an extra session may be called
at any time. A peculiar feature is that during
the recess of Congress a committee consisting
of seven from each house acts for that
body, and is consulted by the President on all
matters of importance.</p>

<p>The President is chosen by electors, who are
elected by direct vote, for a term of five years.
He serves the state for a salary of about eleven
thousand dollars, including the allowance for
expenses. He is ineligible to serve two consecutive
terms and may not leave the country
during his term of office, or for one year after
its expiration, without the consent of Congress.
He has a cabinet of six secretaries, who are
known as Ministers of Interior, Foreign Affairs,
Justice and Public Instruction, Treasury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
War and Marine, Industry and Public
Works. The Minister of the Interior is the
Vice-President, and succeeds to the office of
President in the event of his death or disability.
Elections are held on the 25th of June
every fifth year, and inauguration of the new
President follows on the succeeding 18th of
September. The cabinet may be forced to resign
at any time by a vote of lack of confidence
by Congress, to whom they are directly
responsible. In addition to the cabinet there
is a Council of State consisting of eleven members,
six of whom are appointed by Congress
and five by the President, who assist that official
in an advisory capacity. Furthermore,
when Congress adjourns, it appoints a standing
committee of seven from each house, which
acts as the representative of that body during
vacation. The President must consult with it
in certain matters, and the committee may request
him to call an extraordinary session if,
in their opinion, such a course is advisable.</p>

<p>There is a national Supreme Court of seven
members that sits at Santiago, which is the
final judicial authority. Courts of appeal consisting
of from five to twelve members also sit
at Santiago, Valparaiso, Tacna, Serena, Talca,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Valdivia and Concepción. There are also a
number of minor courts which are located in
the various provinces and departments. Each
province is governed by an <i>intendente</i>, who is
appointed by the President of the republic.
The departments are governed by governors,
who are subordinate to the <i>intendentes</i>, and
the districts by inspectors, who are also appointed.
The only popular element is the municipal
district, or commune, which is governed
by a board composed of nine men, who are
elected by direct vote in each municipality.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards reached Chile they
found native races occupying it. In the northern
portions the tribes were under at least the
nominal sway of the Incas, although separated
from them either by the inhospitable Andes or
dreary desert wastes. In the great central
valley, however, the land appeared a pleasant
garden, and so rich that nowhere had the Spaniards
seen anything similar either for its fertility
or the wealth of its fruits and herds.
“It is all an inhabited place and a sown land
or a gold-mine, rich in herds as that of Peru,
with a fibre drawn from the soil rich in food
supplies sown by the Indians for their subsistence”—so
wrote the chroniclers. They lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in comfort and had a certain civilization. Each
<i>cacique</i> had his own ranch house, the number
of doors indicating the number of his wives,
of which some had as many as fifteen. These
people were the Araucanians, who proved to
be a brave and courageous race. The Spaniards
immediately began their usual cruelties
and efforts to enslave these people, but succeeded
only temporarily. The natives soon
rose in rebellion. Three hundred years of warfare
decimated their ranks, but did not subdue
them, and when the Spanish rule ended these
people were as unconquered as when it began.
Their history has been written in blood, but
it is the struggle of a heroic race, and it is not
dimmed by the excesses and cruelties that attached
to the Spaniards in their efforts to subjugate
and enslave these valiant people.</p>

<p>After he had conquered Peru, Pizarro sent
an expedition south to explore the country and
take possession of it in the name of the King
of Spain. One of his lieutenants, Diego de
Almagro, was placed in charge. He crossed
the great nitrate desert and reached as far as
Copiapó, where he was driven back by hostile
Indians. He had reached a valley called by the
natives Tchili, which signified in their language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
beautiful, and that name was given to the country.
A few years later, in 1540, another expedition
was fitted out under Captain Pedro de
Valdivia, which was more successful. He
marched as far as the present city of Santiago,
and founded a city, which has ever since remained
the capital. Although colonists came
from Spain, little progress was made for a
long time because of the hostility of the Araucanian
Indians. These attacks continued until
1640, when a treaty was concluded with these
indomitable natives by which the Bio-Bio River
was established as the boundary, and both together
were to resist the English and Dutch
buccaneers, who had begun to harass the coast.
Early in the nineteenth century the spirit of
independence reached Chile, and insurrections
against the Spanish authorities broke out.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, 1810, the Spanish
authorities were deposed and a provisional
government was set up. Troops were poured
in by Spain, and it was not until 1818, when
the Spanish troops were defeated in the battle
of Maipu by the Argentine general, San Martin,
that freedom from the foreign yoke was
secured. General Don Ambrosio O’Higgins,
an Irish patriot who had greatly distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
himself in the war for freedom, was chosen as
the first President, and he introduced many
reforms and endeavoured to ameliorate the
condition of the natives. The Jesuit missionaries
followed in the wake of the soldiers and
began their work of converting the natives.
Since that time there has been considerable
internal struggle between rival political factions,
and some foreign troubles. There was a
brief war with Spain, a frightful conflict with
the neighbouring republic of Peru, and disagreements
with Bolivia and Argentina. A few
years ago war with the latter country seemed
inevitable over the international boundary, but
wise counsels prevailed and the matter was
successfully arbitrated. At the present time
peace prevails, although there are continual
mutterings in Peru, and that country only
needs a hot-headed leader to bring about another
war with Chile over the lost revenue
from the nitrate fields.</p>

<p>The Chileans are a brave and a courageous
people. The natural boundaries have no doubt
aided in developing a national spirit and love
of independence. Truly no people in South
America have fought so long and so hard to
achieve national independence. The Araucanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mixture has brought virility and industry
into the race—a far different element than
the Inca blood farther north. These Yankees
of the South American continent have accomplished
much, and there is still greater promise
for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WEST COAST</span></h2>

<p>Cruising along the west coast of South
America is a delightful experience. It is the
perfection of ocean travel. One is always sure
of fine weather, for it neither rains nor blows,
and the swell is seldom strong enough to make
even the susceptible person seasick. In defiance
of our idea of geography the sailors speak
of going “up” the coast, when bound towards
the south. The boats along this coast are built
for fair weather and tropical seas. They have
their cabins opening seaward, and the decks
reach down almost to the water’s edge. Some
swing hammocks and sleep on deck, and it is
very comfortable. Such vessels would not be
adapted for the stormy Atlantic, and would
not live long in a storm upon the Caribbean
Sea. Sailors say that the wind is never strong
enough to “ruffle the fur on a cat’s back,” and
this immense stretch of sea might be likened
unto a great mill pond. It is this part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ocean, between the Isthmus and Peru, that suggested
to the Spaniards the name of Pacific.</p>

<p>Near the equator the days and nights are
equal. The sun ceases doing duty promptly
at six, and reappears at the same hour the following
morning. There is no twilight, little
gloaming, and darkness succeeds daylight almost
as soon as the big red ball disappears in
the western sea. At night beautiful phosphorescence
may be seen. The water is so impregnated
with phosphorus, that each tiny wave is
tipped with a light and the vessel leaves a trail
of fire. From above the Southern Cross looks
down upon the scene in complaisance. And
thus the days pass in succession one after the
other. The temperature is not uncomfortable,
as the Antarctic Current tempers the tropical
sun, and there is generally a southerly or
southwesterly wind that aids. It is a pleasanter
ride, and subject to fewer inconveniences
than the ride along the eastern coast of the
continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WEST COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>When the Stars and Stripes have faded from
view at Balboa, and the jagged backbone of
the continent has disappeared into the mists
on either horizon, towards Nicaragua and Colombia,
one feels that a new world has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
reached. The real South America has been
entered, and, when the good ship crosses the
Line, about the third day out, home and the
rest of the world seem very far away. It is
a long journey to Valparaiso, Chile, if one
takes a steamer that stops at all the intermediate
ports, as it lasts more than three weeks.
There are swifter vessels, however, that avoid
Ecuador and make the journey in twelve days.
The slower vessels follow the coast line, and
the passenger is given many a view of the
Andes, whose peaks are crowned with eternal
snows but are frequently wrapped in fleecy
clouds. At Guayaquil, the westernmost city of
South America, it is even possible on occasions
in clear weather to see Chimborazo, eighty
miles from the sea. Nowhere in the world is
there a greater assembly of lofty peaks than
will be seen as the vessel proceeds along the
coast. The Spaniards called these “sierras,”
because their uneven summits resembled the
teeth of a saw. Some of the peaks are regular
in outline, but more often they are irregular
and even grotesque, so that the imaginative
minds of the natives have fancied resemblances
to works of nature and have given them corresponding
names. Nowhere in the world are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there stranger freaks in geological formations,
or more startling contrasts. Near the coast
run the foothills, which gradually become
higher and bolder until they end in the loftiest
peaks. Back, and beyond all, an occasional
volcanic peak may be seen lifting itself in solitary
grandeur.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Guayas River, in Ecuador,
there is a dense growth of tropical vegetation.
It seems to be a veritable hothouse of
nature, where plants and trees wage a desperate
war for existence against the vines, mosses
and other parasites that attack them. This is
the end of such scenes, however, for days and
days. It would be difficult to find a more
dreary aspect than the coast of South America
from the boundary of Ecuador almost to
Valparaiso. From the water’s edge to the
Andes chain of mountains stretches a yellow
and brown desert, unrelieved by a tinge of
green, except where irrigation has been employed.
At midday all is clear, but in the
evening a purple haze covers the whole landscape.
It bears a close resemblance to parts
of Arizona and New Mexico in general characteristics.
Cliffs three hundred to four hundred
feet high, and which are scooped out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fantastic shapes, often form the water’s edge.
The distant mountains look gloomy and forbidding.
It very seldom rains there, perhaps
once in six or seven years is a fair average.
In other places a generation can almost grow
up and pass away without an experience with
rain. When it does rain, however, the desertlike
plains and slopes immediately spring into
life. Where for years there has been nothing
but drifting sands appear meadows of nutritious
grasses, and flowers and plants spring up
in great confusion. Wherever the seeds come
from is a mystery, but every nook and corner
is soon ablaze with vegetation.</p>

<p>The boats stop at many ports from Ecuador
to Chile. These little towns will be found
nestling in little hollows at the foot of the hills,
or tacked on the hillside. Each one is walled
away from the other, and each is a gateway
to a fertile valley or rich mining section.
Sometimes a narrow gauge railway runs back
into the interior, but there are no connections
coastwise. The steamer furnishes the only
communication with the world beyond, and the
arrival of the boat is an event of great importance.
Each town has its own specialty.
At Guayaquil and Paita many merchants will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
come aboard with Panama hats, and good-natured
bargaining will then be carried on with
the passengers. Buying a hat is a tedious matter.
The seller does not expect more than
about one-third of the price he asks. If the
passenger looks indifferent the native will hunt
him up and reduce his offer. “How much
would the señor give?” “Thirty soles! That
would be robbery.” But the ship’s gong
strikes and the time of departure is at hand.
“Here, señor, is your hat. <i>Muchas gracias.
Adios!</i>” The deal is concluded, and you have
your hat at the price you offered, if you are
shrewd enough to see that a cheaper hat was
not substituted at the last minute. Deck traders
board the vessel and stay with it for days,
doing a good business in almost everything
from vegetables and fruits to dry goods, and
jewelry. Parrots, monkeys and even mild-eyed
ant-eaters are offered the passengers for pets.
Passengers join the boat at every stop, and,
instead of hat boxes, as American women
would be burdened with, the women here all
bring on board their bird cages with their
noisy occupants. Swarthy Spaniards and the
darker-hued natives join the boat, many of
them dressed in gay attire, and particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wearing gaudy neckties and waistcoats. The
boat always anchors at some distance from the
shore, while passengers and freight are brought
out either in lighters or row-boats. At some
places a dozen lighters may be filled with
freight for the steamer. The ship’s crew bring
up from the hold scores of bales and boxes
with labels familiar and unfamiliar. International
commerce becomes real—almost a
thing of flesh and blood. Each sling load
brought up from the hold has its own tale to
tell, and everyone becomes commercialized.
The crowing of roosters at night, the bleating
of sheep and bawling of the cattle remind you
of a country barnyard at times, for the boat
carries its own live stock, which are killed as
the conditions of the larder demand. Thus it
is that these slow galleons float along the coast
past Paita, Pacasmayo, Salaverry, Pisco and
the rest of the little ports. Five minutes after
the ladder would be lowered the deck would
become a floating bazaar.</p>

<p>Guayaquil is the port for the equatorial republic
of Ecuador. Quite a business is done
there, for more than one-third of the world’s
supply of cacao beans, from which our chocolate
is made, comes through this port. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
generally infested with more or less fever, and
most people prefer to make their stay as short
as possible. One of the curious things to attract
the traveller’s attention is to see the
mules with their legs encased in trousers. This
is not due to any excessive modesty on the part
of the inhabitants, for children several years
old may be seen without as much clothing on.
The purpose is to protect the legs of the animals
from the bite of the gadfly, which is very
numerous here. It was near Guayaquil that
Pizarro landed with one hundred and eighty
men to conquer the empire of the Incas. The
capital of Ecuador, Quito, lies in a saucer-shaped
cup at the foot of Mt. Pichincha, with
many other lofty peaks in sight. It perhaps
retains more of the original characteristics
than any other city of South America. It vies
with the City of Mexico the distinction of being
the oldest city of the Americas. For centuries
prior to the coming of the Spaniards it was the
capital of one of the branches of the Incas, and
Atahualpa used to eat his meals off plates
made of solid gold. Hitherto accessible only
over a long and difficult mountain trail, which
was impassable during half of the year, Quito
can now be reached by a railroad—thanks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
American enterprise. No less than twenty volcanoes
are visible from the track, of which
three are active, five dormant and twelve are
classed as extinct.</p>

<p>Callao (pronounced Cal-ya-o) is the principal
port of Peru. It is always full of steamers
and masts and has a general aspect of business.
More than a thousand vessels touch here every
twelve months. Its history has been exciting
and there are many monuments to its heroes.
Some warships are generally floating in the
harbour. Lima is distant but seven miles from
Callao, and it is a ride of only twenty minutes
by an excellent electric road of American construction
throughout. To the hum of the trolley
one is hurried past irrigated fields, beautiful
gardens and villas, and Inca ruins many
centuries old. As the boats remain at Callao
for a day the traveller is able to spend a few
hours in the “City of the Kings,” as Pizarro
christened it. Lima is a wonderfully interesting
city, and its history is full of romance. It
preserves in wood and stone the spirit of old
Spain as it was transplanted into the New
World. Carved balconies, which were patterned
after their native Andalusia, still overhang
the narrow streets of the Peruvian capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Up-to-date electric cars whirl past old monastery
walls where life has scarcely changed in
three centuries. The Limaños are an easy-going,
pleasure-loving people, among whom the
strenuous life has few disciples. It has been
the scene of many revolutions, and the marks
of street fighting are numerous. Churches and
ecclesiastical institutions abound on every
hand, and ecclesiastics are numerous on the
streets. The cathedral, in which the sacristan
will show the alleged bones of Francisco Pizarro,
is a fine specimen of architecture—one
of the best in the world. On another corner
of the plaza is the passageway from which the
conspirators emerged on their way to assassinate
the conqueror. The building which was
the headquarters of the Inquisition in South
America occupies still another site on the
plaza.</p>

<p class="caption">A MILK BOY IN PERU.</p>
</div>

<p>Pisco is the next port of importance, and
it is situated near a rich and fertile irrigated
valley where sugar-cane grows abundantly. It
is the port also for the interior towns of Ayacucho
and Huancavelica, where numerous rich
mines are found. Just a few miles out at sea
are the Chincha Islands, from which Peru obtained
such a large revenue for the guano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
found there. These deposits, once considered
inexhaustible, because in places they were
eighty feet or more in depth, have been almost
exhausted. The great wealth received from
them and nitrate has been dissipated.</p>

<p>At Mollendo, the last Peruvian port, there is
a railway that runs to La Paz, the capital of
the inland republic of Bolivia. It is a surf-lashed
port where vessels are sometimes unable
to land their passengers and freight. In
fact the landing is through a “sort of Niagara
Gorge gateway of rock, which gives to the mere
landing some of the noise and a good deal of
the excitement of a rescue at sea.” It takes
three days’ travel to reach La Paz from Mollendo,
as the train only runs by day. The first
stage of the trip, as far as Arequipa, is over
an almost trackless desert, where the wind
piles the sand up in movable half-moon heaps.
The sand-storms of the centuries have covered
everything with these whitish particles, and
the dusted peaks and hillocks stand out without
relief of any kind. The second day brings
the traveller to Lake Titicaca, the sacred lake
of the Incas, which is crossed by boat, and a
side trip will take the traveller to Cuzco, the
capital of the Inca confederacy. Lake Titicaca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is the highest and one of the most wonderful
lakes in the world. It is larger than all the
lakes of Switzerland together, and lies in a
hollow two and one-half miles above the waters
of the ocean. Lying in a peaceful valley, in
a scene of desolate grandeur, where the trees
are stunted and only a few of the hardiest
plants survive, lies La Paz. The City of Peace,
its name indicates, but this city has been the
scene of turmoil and strife entirely foreign to
its name ever since the Spaniards invaded
these solitudes. Bolivia is another Tibet—one
of the highest inhabited plateaus in the
world, as well as one of the richest mineral
sections.</p>

<p>In no part of the world, perhaps, is there
such an abundance of life in sea and air as
along the coast of Peru. Soon after leaving
Callao the tedium of the voyage is relieved by
the flight of millions upon millions of birds.
There are gulls, ducks, cormorants, divers of
all kinds and great pelicans with huge pouches
under their bills. The sea is as animated as
the air, and schools of fish, innumerable in
numbers, may be seen darting through the
water with their fins showing above its surface.
Danger besets them from above and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from beneath. The divers poise on wing every
few minutes and then drop suddenly into the
sea like a flash. For a few seconds they disappear
beneath the surface, and then reappear
with a fish in their bills. The lumbering and
stately pelicans drop with a mighty splash that
sends up a dash of spray. These greedy birds
continue this foraging process until their
pouches are so filled with fish that they are
unable to rise out of the water until the load
is digested or they disgorge themselves. The
seals and sea lions keep themselves as busy as
the birds, and constantly display their sinuous
and shiny bodies above the surface, as they
pursue the fish or come up to breathe.</p>

<p>We passed by the famous guano islands just
before nightfall. The air was filled with birds,
all of which were flying toward a great island
that lifted up its rocky surface above the blue
of the sea. At some distance above the sea
were the smaller birds, which, at a distance,
looked like mere specks against the sky. A
little lower were the pelicans flying in single
file, and in flocks of from twelve to thirty.
They seemed to play the game of “follow the
leader,” for if the leader poised his wings or
lifted himself higher all did the same. Near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the surface were divers, called “pirates” in
the local parlance, in flocks of a thousand or
more. They sailed along just above the surface
of the water and continually altered their
formation. With the naked eye the number of
birds was myriad, but the telescope showed
ten times as many. As far as one could see
there was the same multitude of birds, all heading
for this one island. The island itself was
black with the birds already settled for the
night, but each new arrival seemed to find a
resting place either on the surface of the rock
or in the caves underneath. For countless
ages these birds have occupied these sterile
volcanic rocks as their resting place, and have
deposited the guano which has brought millions
of dollars of wealth into the Peruvian
treasury. A glimpse of this remarkable bird
life shows how the guano has accumulated in
such enormous quantities.</p>

<p class="caption">ROW BOATS CROWDING AROUND A STEAMER.</p>
</div>

<p>The northern part of Chile contains the
dreariest section of this forlorn coast. There
are no harbours, and a tremendous surf which
rolls half way around the world before it
strikes a breakwater dashes into foam upon
these beaches. Several prosperous towns are
located here as a result of the workings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
nature’s laboratories. To reach these ports it
is necessary to trust yourself to one of the
boatmen, who crowd around the ladder as soon
as the vessel drops anchor. Judicious bargaining
is always advisable, and never pay the
boatman until he has returned you safely to
your floating hotel. The boat is guided
through the surf with amazing skill, and it is
very seldom that an accident occurs. They
sometimes crowd each other off, however, in
their eagerness to get the best position at the
bottom of the ladder and secure the first passengers.
But all these men are good swimmers,
and the only result is a good wetting and
much amusement for the steamer’s passengers
who welcome any diversion.</p>

<p>Arica is the first port of importance in Chile
at the north. It is only a day’s journey from
Mollendo, the last Peruvian port. The Peruvian
heaves a sigh when he enters Arica, but
there is some hope in it, for he trusts to add
this province to Peru’s possessions at some
time in the future again. But at Iquique the
hope fades, for sovereignty is lost for ever.
Although not a large town, Arica has been the
scene of several memorable events. It was
here that were built the boats which carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the troops for the conquest of Chile. It was
at that time a place of some importance among
the natives, and the valleys back of it were
densely populated and were cultivated by
means of irrigation. Sir Francis Drake
touched at this place in 1579, and found a collection
of Indian huts on the shore. It is supposed
to have been founded in 1250 by the
Incas. It is like an oasis in the desert to the
traveller who has coasted along the shore for
days or weeks without seeing vegetation. At
the present time it is famous for its oranges.
They are grown in the rich valleys that lie
behind the rather unattractive and forbidding
hills next to the coast, and through the opening
in the flat-topped hills one is permitted to catch
glimpses of these valleys. Near the coast is
a prehistoric cemetery filled with dead bodies,
which were embalmed with almost as great
skill as the mummies of Egypt.</p>

<p>Arica is a pleasant little place of several
thousand inhabitants. There is a handsome
little plaza which encloses a plot of shrubbery
adorned with morning-glories and purple vine
trees. One of the striking features is the brilliant
colouring of the houses. There is also a
rather imposing parochial church which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
painted in the gaudiest colours that I have seen
in any country; and it would be hard to duplicate
it anywhere, even in Spanish America, a
land of rich colouring. It used to be a great
market for the skins of the vicuña, which are
so beautiful. In late years, however, the skins
are becoming less plentiful and the prices have
jumped accordingly. The harbour is commodious
and well sheltered. Interesting glimpses
of native life are afforded by the Indian women
coming to town. Some of them ride astride,
being almost concealed by the huge panniers
containing their market produce. Others
trudge along by the side of the animals.</p>

<p>From this city a highway runs into the interior
of Peru and Bolivia, which was constructed
by the Incas a thousand years ago and
has been used ever since. To-day caravans of
mules, donkeys and llamas may be seen constantly
passing up and down this ancient trail.
They bring down ore and take back mining
supplies and miscellaneous merchandise. It is
known as the “camino real,” and is several
hundred miles long. Near here is supposed to
be the underground outlet of Lakes Titicaca
and Poopo. One argument advanced in favour
of this theory is that a certain kind of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
water fish that abounds in that lake is caught
in considerable numbers in the ocean near this
town. It has been the scene of several disastrous
earthquakes. On August 13th, 1868, it
was almost washed away, and many of its inhabitants
perished in a tidal wave which came
without warning and devastated the coast for
a hundred miles. Two United States men-of-war,
which were in the harbour at that time,
were lifted from their anchorage by waves
sixty feet high and carried inland a mile over
the roofs of the town. One of the vessels, the
<i>Fredonia</i>, was dashed against a ledge of rocks
and entirely destroyed, while the other, the
<i>Wateree</i>, was left lying in the sand. Everyone
on the former boat was lost and about half
of the latter. For many years the boat lying
on the sand was used as a boarding house for
the railway employees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus7">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE HARBOUR OF ARICA.</p>
</div>

<p>On June 7th, 1880, Arica was the scene of
a furious battle and a terrible massacre. At
one end of the town, and directly on the sea
front, is a promontory, which rises six hundred
feet above the sea almost precipitously. On
this rock, which is known as the Morro, the
Peruvians had erected a powerful battery to
defend the harbour. The Chileans, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
landed a force of four thousand men several
miles below at night. In the morning the Peruvians
found themselves attacked in the rear
with no means of escape. As their guns were
pointed to the sea they were useless to defend
against those back on the landward side. Although
short of small arms and ammunition,
the Peruvians made a heroic defence and engaged
in a hand-to-hand contest that lasted for
an hour. At the end of that time the commander
leaped over the precipice into the sea,
and his body was crushed to a pulp among the
rocks. Several hundred of his soldiers followed
him, preferring to die that way to having
their throats cut by the Chileans. For
months afterward their bodies could be seen
lying where they had lodged on the jutting
rocks below. It is claimed that seventeen hundred
Peruvians were killed, as this was the
total strength of the garrison and no prisoners
were taken. On a slab near the slope of the
rock is an inscription in whitewashed stone,
“Viva Battalion No. 4.” It was placed there
by the victorious Chileans to commemorate the
heroism of the enemy.</p>

<p>Arica is in the province of Tacna, which is
the most northerly province in the republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and is about the size of New Jersey. Agriculture
in this province is very limited, and
there has not been much of mineral development.
There are some veins of copper and
lead, and some scattered deposits of nitrate as
well that have not been worked. A railroad
from Arica runs back to the city of Tacna, the
capital, which is one of the oldest railroads in
South America. It is quite an important town,
and is situated in a valley made fertile by irrigation.
A railroad is now being built across the
Cordilleras from this city to connect with the
Bolivian railways. When that is completed it
is believed that this line will be the best one,
as it is the shortest, and every traveller is
anxious to escape as much of the dust in crossing
the desert region as possible. It is only
a little over three hundred miles from Arica
to La Paz. This road will add to the importance
of Arica, for it will be one of the main
arteries of commerce from Bolivia to the outside
world, but it is not likely to help Tacna
any in its growth.</p>

<p>The next province adjoining Tacna is Tarapacá,
which is one of the wealthiest sections
in the Americas because of its nitrate deposits.
It contains the richest nitrate region in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
world. From Arica the cliffs rise up almost
perpendicularly from the sea for the first day’s
journey. Pisagua, the first port as you travel
“up” the coast, is a city of about five thousand.
This port does not differ much from a
mining town in the States. Although considerable
shipping is done here, Pisagua fades in
importance beside its more important rivals.</p>

<p>“We do not want rain in Iquique.”</p>

<p>This statement was made to me by the manager
of the nitrate trust, who lives in that prosperous
city of thirty thousand or more inhabitants,
and which is one hundred and eleven
miles south of Arica. It was the first time I
had ever heard of a community that did not
desire rainfall. Water used to be brought
by boat from more favoured regions, and was
peddled through the streets at so much a quart
or gallon. At times it is said to have sold as
high as two dollars per gallon. A pipe line one
hundred and fifty miles long now supplies this
necessary liquid to this city, and it is sold by
the metre instead of being put up in pint or
quart bottles.</p>

<p>A walk through this city on the edge of the
sea, with bare, brown and rugged hills for a
background, showed not a blade of grass, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
on the public squares and in a few diminutive
courtyards within the houses, where the
hand of man supplied the necessary water for
growth. It is little wonder that lawn-mowers
are a drug on the market in Iquique. The
sun is fierce, and its unrelenting rays, absorbed
and reflected by the vast area of desert waste,
inflame the air to almost furnace heat. The
streets are dusty and the fine particles get into
your ears and nostrils, and you can almost
taste it on your tongue. Many of the houses
have a piazza on top, or a second roof, to break
the force of the sun’s rays. The Arturo Prat
Square has been made quite attractive, and is
ornamented with a very creditable statue of
that hero. Business around the shipping quarters
is always lively, as it is bound to be where
such an enormous export and import trade is
carried on. In 1891, during the revolutionary
fighting between the Balmacedists and Congressists,
the custom house was the scene of a
stubborn battle. The town was set on fire and
confusion and disorder reigned supreme. At
the present time Iquique is an important port
and more than one thousand vessels enter it
each year.</p>

<p>The dreariness and unattractiveness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
surroundings is hard to describe. Street cars
with girls as conductors, good stores, the telephone
and other modern conveniences, and
even comfortable clubs do not make up for the
lack of green vegetation. The groceries are
filled with condensed milk from England, sardines
from France, sausages from Germany,
cheese from Holland, jellies and jam from
Britain, and macaroni from Italy. But fresh
vegetables and meats are at a premium, and
unnatural tastes are developed. Many English
live in Iquique. They are great brandy
drinkers, and show discrimination “in not exhausting
the wealth of the nitrate beds by
taking too much soda in their brandy,” as one
writer says. Nevertheless the people are
happy, for wealth lies at their very doors and
rain would cause great loss. By reason of this
Iquique has grown until it is second only to
Valparaiso in commercial importance. It has
grown with a swiftness than can only be compared
with our own western towns. In the
first days of the saltpetre era nothing went
slow and the town spread like magic. Much of
the population is a rough one and hard to
govern, but the authorities have done well.
The battles that have been fought with fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in Iquique and on this coast have cost
many lives and much privation. A few have
acquired fortune, but more have not even obtained
a modest competence in return for the
deprivation and sacrifice endured. Whatever
has been gained at the cost of much labour and
privation has been fully earned by some one—and
perhaps by one who did not reap the
reward.</p>

<p class="caption">A STREET SCENE, ANTOFAGASTA.</p>
</div>

<p>The province of Antofagasta joins that of
Tarapacá on the south. Tocopilla is the first
port of importance, but Antofagasta, a little
over two hundred miles from Iquique, is the
principal city. This province is a desert in
appearance similar to the other, and this city
can boast no advantages over its more northerly
rival. Antofagasta is almost on the
Tropic of Capricorn, and is in about the same
latitude as Rio de Janeiro, on the Atlantic
coast. It lies almost at the foot of some hills
that are quite high, and is a city of about
twenty thousand. The dull-coloured houses
can scarcely be distinguished from the sombre
hills at a distance. The dust is anything but
pleasant. A great deal of nitrate and some
copper are shipped from Antofagasta. There
are several small wharves, but everything has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to be transferred to lighters. The harbour is
a wretched roadstead and, to get ashore, one
has to brave a lashing surf. The pride of the
city is a little plaza, where considerable coaxing
has caused a little evidence of green from
the grass and a few trees. A narrow gauge
railroad, two feet and six inches in width, runs
from here to La Paz, and a great deal of
freight is transshipped to Bolivian towns.</p>

<p>The province of Atacama comes next, which
does not differ much in physical characteristics
from the three previously named. In some of
the valleys, where water can be secured for
irrigation, a little agriculture is attempted.
There are also a number of minerals to be
found, but not so much as in Tarapacá and
Antofagasta. Caldera, the principal port, is
two hundred and seven miles from Antofagasta,
and has a well sheltered bay. The oldest
railroad in South America connects this
port with Copiapó, the capital of the province.
This city is situated in a fertile valley on the
banks of a river of the same name. It is an
old and quite important town, and has a number
of educational institutions. It will soon be
connected with Santiago by the longitudinal
railway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The last of the northern provinces is that
of Coquimbo. This province is really at the
end of the dry zone, and there are a number
of rich valleys where the land is fertile and
agriculture flourishes. It is a mining province
as well, and a great deal of mineral wealth has
been discovered. Guayacan is a port, but the
principal port is Coquimbo, which is only a
couple of hundred miles from Valparaiso. It
has a population of probably ten thousand. The
city extends along the bay in an irregular manner
for some distance. The capital of the
province is La Serena, and it is only a few
miles from Coquimbo. There is nothing especially
in its favour, although an attractive little
city, but it is a relief from the dreary places
farther north which have been mentioned.</p>

<p>Every one going this way is bound for Valparaiso.
The voyager, who has journeyed
twenty-six hundred miles along the Pacific
coast, hails with delight the beautiful half-moon
bay in which that city is located. He
welcomes the splash of the anchor, which
means a speedy transfer to the shore and the
comforts of a good hotel. Many disasters have
been recorded in this bay. In the winter terrific
storms arise, and steamers oftentimes lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
their anchors and steam out into the open sea
for safety. The largest steamers are tossed
about like eggshells, while the buoys bob
around like water-sprites. The enthusiastic
Chilean loves to compare it with the Bay of
Naples. But it is not Naples. The waters are
not so blue, nor the skies as perfect, but it has
a charm all its own. A row boat or launch
quickly transfers the traveller to the landing
steps, and courteous officials promptly pass the
baggage. Then a short ride in a rickety carriage,
and the doors of the Royal Hotel hospitably
open to receive the guests.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">VALE OF PARADISE</span></h2>

<p>Val-paraiso means the “Vale of Paradise,”
and it is the name of both a province and a
city. The name is so incongruous on this unattractive
shore as to cause a smile, for the location
of Valparaiso does not merit any such
appellation. It was so named after a little
town in Spain, which was the home of Juan
de Saavedra, the man who captured the Indian
village located at this point in 1536. There is
only a narrow strip of land between the bay
and the barren hills behind it, which, in places,
rise up to a thousand or fifteen hundred feet
in height. At one place it is wide enough for
only two streets, which are very close together.
At other places this ledge creeps back farther,
but nowhere does the gap between sea and hills
exceed half a mile, and a part of this has been
reclaimed from the sea. Through the centre
of this level space runs Victoria Street, which
follows the coast line the entire length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
city and is several miles in length. It is the
main commercial street, and is lined with business
houses, public buildings and even private
residences.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN “ASCENSOR” IN VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>It used to be that all of the city was built
on this narrow strip of land. Little by little,
however, the city has crept up the side of the
hills, and the streets rise in terraces one above
the other. On the edges of the cliffs in many
places the poorer classes have built for themselves
dwellings of the rudest kind from all
sorts of debris. Some of these are perched
upon almost inaccessible rocks, and are
propped up with wooden supports. On the
extreme upper part of the rock has been built
the real residence quarter, and many fine
homes are found there. It is reached by steep
and winding roads, which tire the pedestrian
not used to them; but there are a dozen inclined
elevators, or “ascensors,” as they are
called in Valparaiso, which carry the passenger
to the upper heights for a very small sum.
Up the steep roadway the poor horses may be
seen drawing their loads, while the drivers
beat them and vociferously berate them with
their tongues.</p>

<p>From the heights one has a magnificent view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the bay, which is like a half-moon, and is one
of the prettiest bays in the world. It has a
northern exposure, however, and is subject to
terrific storms in the winter season, which lash
the seas into a fury and the waves beat upon
the sea front with destructive force. It is still
to all extents and purposes an open roadstead,
although plans have been drawn for a breakwater
to provide a sheltered harbour. The
drawback has been that the bay is very deep
only a short distance from shore, and the problem
of building such a protection is a difficult
one. The surface of the bay is always dotted
with vessels from almost every quarter of the
globe. One can at any time see the flags of
a half dozen or more different nations floating
from the mastheads. Then there are hundreds
of small lighters which are used to carry the
freight between vessel and shore, as no docks
have been constructed at which vessels can unload.
In the far distance may be seen, on a
clear day, the backbone of the continent, the
Andes, with its serrated ridges and snowy
summits glistening in the sunlight. The hoary
head of Aconcagua, the highest peak of the
Cordilleras, can easily be distinguished from
the others by reason of its superior height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to San Francisco, Valparaiso is the
most important port on the eastern shores of
the Pacific. This city of two hundred thousand
has as much commerce as the average
town of double that size, as it is the port for
Santiago and the greater part of Chile. A
business-like character is impressed upon the
entire city. Here live the men who design and
carry out the vast nitrate and mining enterprises
of northern Chile, and practically all
business, except that of politics, is managed
from this city. The docks and warehouses are
at all times busy places, and are crowded with
boxes and bales from almost every commercial
nation. Banditti-like <i>rotos</i> drive carts and
wagons filled with merchandise. One of the
first sights after being set down on the landing-stage
is the two-wheeled dray of Valparaiso.
It is drawn by two or three wiry and sweating
horses, on the back of one of which rides the
driver, who lashes the horses unmercifully.
The ridden horse is hitched by a trace just
outside the shafts, and he is trained to push
at the shaft with his shoulder, or pull at right
angles when the occasion arises, and in every
way is as clever as any Texas bronco. One
of these drays with the driver lashing his team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
might well figure on the escutcheon of this
city.</p>

<p>The “U. S.” mark is less frequently seen in
Valparaiso than that of Hamburg or London,
for the United States has not become such an
exporting country of manufactured products
as those commercial nations of the older world;
nor is the Yankee in flesh and blood. The predominance
of the British is shown by the prevalence
of the English language. Nearly every
one engaged in business has at least a slight
acquaintance with that tongue. One can not
go far without crossing the path of some ruddy
Briton or voluble Irishman. Many of the best
stores bear English names, and one will see the
same goods displayed as in New York or London.
In fact it is more predominantly English
in appearance than any other city of South
America. There are cafés where they meet
to drink their “half-and-half” or other beverages,
and there is a club where the <i>Times</i>,
<i>Punch</i>, and other favourites can be read. It
is said that the foreign population almost
equals the native in numbers. Only a small
part of this foreign element is English, as there
are many Italians, Germans and French, but
the English are the bankers and tradesmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and have impressed their characteristics more
forcibly upon the city than the other nations.
There are amusements in plenty, for there are
clubs, concerts and an abundance of theatres
to provide recreation as a relaxation from the
strenuous life. There are tennis grounds, football
fields and a golf course at Viña. There
are many monuments over the city in the
plazas and on the new alameda, erected to the
nation’s heroes, and one to William Wheelwright,
the American who did so much to aid
Chile in developing her transportation facilities.
The naval school, which crowns one of
the hills, is one of the most attractive places
in Valparaiso, and provides one of the finest
views of the bay and surrounding hills.</p>

<p>“One of the great advantages of life in Valparaiso,”
says Arthur Ruhl in “The Other
Americans,” “is the absence of a professional
fire department. The glorious privilege of
fighting fires is appropriated by the <i>élite</i>, who
organize themselves into clubs, with much the
same social functions as the Seventh Regiment
and Squadron A in New York, wear ponderous
helmets and march in procession in great style
whenever they get a chance. One comes upon
these <i>bomberos</i> practising in the evening, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Avenida, for instance, in store clothes and
absent-mindedly puffing cigarettes, getting a
stream on an imaginary blaze. In any emergency
they perform much the same duties as
our militia.</p>

<p>“It is the delightful privilege of the <i>bombero</i>
to drop his work whenever the alarm is
given, dash from his office to the blaze, and
there man hose-lines, smash windows, chop
down partitions, and indulge to the fullest one
of the keenest primordial emotions of man. Inasmuch
as buildings are seldom more than two
or three stories in height and built of masonry,
there is comparatively little danger of a large
conflagration, and the average of one fire in
four days is ‘just about right,’ as one of my
Valparaiso acquaintances explained, ‘to give
a man exercise.’ Their only unhappiness, he
said, was that there were about fifteen hundred
firemen in town, and they were getting so expert
that what one could call a really ‘good’
fire was almost unknown.”</p>

<p>Like its commercial rival, San Francisco,
Valparaiso suffered from a destructive earthquake
in 1906. Slight quakes are quite common
in this city, but the inhabitants do not
seem to fear them, and go along the even tenor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of their way as though such a thing as an
earthquake was unknown. In one year as
many as thirty-five shocks have been recorded,
but the one mentioned above is the only one
for a half century or more in which any lives
were lost. In fact Valparaiso has had its full
share of troubles and vicissitudes of all kinds.
It was captured and sacked three times by buccaneers,
twice by the British and once by a
Dutch pirate. It has suffered severely from
earthquake shocks on half a dozen different
occasions, was destroyed by fire in 1858, bombarded
by the Spanish fleet in 1866, and much
property was destroyed in the Balmaceda revolution
a little later. Few cities in the New
World have had a career so troubled and diversified.</p>

<p>The most disastrous experience in the history
of Valparaiso occurred in 1906. On the
16th of August of that year, only four months
after the destruction of San Francisco, the
greater part of the city was destroyed by an
earthquake and the fire that followed. The day
had been unusually calm and pleasant. About
eight o’clock in the evening the first earthquake
shock was felt, which was almost immediately
followed by others. The whole city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
seemed to swing backward and forwards; then
came a sudden jolt, and whole rows of buildings
fell with a terrific crash. The electric
light wires snapped, and gas and water mains
were broken. The city was left in intense darkness,
which was rendered all the more horrible
by the shrieks of the injured and terrified inhabitants.
Fires soon started which, fanned
by a strong wind, soon became conflagrations.
Between the fires and earthquake a large proportion
of the lower town was completely destroyed,
but the upper town was practically
uninjured. Many of the better-built business
houses withstood the earth’s tremblings, and
the wind blew the flames in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The authorities acted promptly in the matter,
so that patrols of troops and armed citizens
were soon on guard. The progress of the
fire was impeded by the use of dynamite. Appeals
for help were sent to Santiago and other
cities, which were responded to as promptly
as possible. There was necessarily some delay,
for telegraph lines and the railroads had likewise
suffered. The shocks continued for the
two following days at irregular intervals,
which likewise interfered with the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
cleaning up the city. A terrific downpour of
rain also added to the confusion of the first
night, for the vivid flashes of lightning and the
clanging of the fire-bells made it a night
not easily forgotten by the inhabitants. The
killed and injured numbered at least three
thousand persons. But fifty thousand or more
were rendered homeless. Thousands of these
were camped on the barren hills above the city,
and thousands more were cared for by boats
in the bay.</p>

<p>Strangely enough no damage was done to the
shipping in the bay. The destruction was not
confined to Valparaiso alone, but extended inland
as far as Los Andes, and many of the small
inland cities near Valparaiso suffered more or
less damage. The property loss in Valparaiso
has been estimated at one hundred million
dollars. Like San Francisco, however, a new
Valparaiso is arising which will be superior
to the old. The greater part of the destroyed
district has been rebuilt in a better and more
enduring manner. The national government
has advanced large sums of money to the municipality,
which, in turn, has given it under
certain conditions to those who suffered losses.
To-day in the business section of Valparaiso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it would be almost impossible, after only five
years, to find evidence of this disastrous earthquake,
but a little farther out its handiwork
can quickly be traced.</p>

<p>There is a quaint side to life in Valparaiso.
A visit to the market reveals many things of
interest. One will first be impressed by the
fine fruits of Chile, for nowhere in the world
can one find more delicious pears, peaches and
plums. The marketers bring their produce in
huge two-wheeled carts drawn by the slow-moving
ox. The stalls presided over by men
and women fill every available inch of space,
until it is almost impossible to force one’s way
through. Everywhere are groups bargaining
over fruits, vegetables or household articles,
for these people dearly love a bargain. Many
show by their faces a tinge of the Indian blood
that runs in their veins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A CHICKEN PEDDLER, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>The peripatetic merchants, who carry supplies
from door to door, come to the market for
their stock in trade. It is invariably carried
on the back of a donkey or mule, as it is difficult
to draw a loaded wagon up the steep ascents.
Their quaint cries may be heard in
almost any part of the city during the morning
hours. As a rule this merchant carries only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
one article, or possibly two or three, if it is
vegetables. The chicken peddler has built little
coops for his birds which take the place of
a saddle. It is interesting to watch him gesticulate
and praise the excellence of his fowls
to the good housewife, or the servant who
comes out in answer to his warning cry. The
scissors-grinder and dealers in notions swell
the list of perigrinating business men who
make the streets vocal with their calls. The
milkman carries the milk in cans swung over
the back of his mule or donkey, or else drives
the cows themselves from door to door.</p>

<p>“<i>Leche de las burras y vacas</i>,” meaning
donkey’s and cow’s milk, was the cry that
reached my ears one morning in Valparaiso.
On looking around I saw a man leading two
donkey mares and three cows through the
streets. Each donkey mare was closely followed
by its pretty but comical little colt. This
is a custom imported from Spain and Italy,
where goats are also taken from door to door
and oftentimes up three or four flights of stairs
to be milked. It might even be possible to find
a milkman with donkeys, cows and goats in
his collection, so that a regular department
store variety of milk could be provided his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
customers. Add to these the camel and reindeer,
and you have the sources of the world’s
milk supply. Donkey’s milk is used a great
deal for babies in South America, as it is considered
better for them than the milk of either
cows or goats. Milk delivered in this way does
not need a sterilized label upon it, or a certificate
from the department of health. Furthermore,
there is very little danger of adulteration.
The housekeeper reaps the benefit of this
style of milk delivery, but it must be a slow
and costly method for the dairyman. It is
another evidence that primitiveness has not
entirely disappeared from Chile.</p>

<p class="caption">A VENDER OF DONKEY’S MILK, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>One other peculiar feature of life in Valparaiso
is that the conductors on all the street
cars are women. This innovation was introduced
in the time of war with Peru, when men
were hard to secure for that work. They did
the work so well that they have been employed
continuously ever since. It can not be said
of them that they are especially attractive, or
even look very jaunty in their uniforms of blue
surmounted by a sailor hat. The fares are the
cheapest I have ever found. The cars are all
double-decked. For two cents one can ride
inside, and it costs only half that rate to ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on the upper deck, which is a far better way
to see the city. The service is good, and there
are more than twenty-five miles of trolley in
and about the city. The electric current for
this as well as lighting is generated by water
power a few miles north of the city, where a
huge dam has been built across a stream.</p>

<p>A night view of Valparaiso from the bay is
delightful. The many electric lamps in all
parts of the city illuminate the otherwise dark
shadows, and are reflected in the waters near
the shore. Here and there move streaks of
light in the lower town, as the electric cars
dash along from one end of the city to the
other; similar lines of light move up and down
in a dozen places, as the “ascensors” carry
their loads between the upper and lower town.
At such times Valparaiso looks like a city of
enchantment, a chosen bit from fairyland.</p>

<p>A trolley line leads out to the aristocratic
suburb of Viña del Mar, where the rich people
of Chile also have their summer residences.
There are some beautiful homes in this city,
of splendid architecture and surrounded by
luxuriant foliage. In these villas the wearied
and worried man of business finds rest after
business hours. For a few months in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
this resort is the centre of the social life
of the republic, and the hotel is so crowded that
it is difficult to secure accommodation, unless
arranged for beforehand. There are delightful
drives, when not too dusty, and then there
are tennis courts, golf links, polo grounds and
other places of recreation. A fine club building
has been erected, where the devotees of games
of chance can find the alluring games that their
natures seem to crave. At Miramar is a small
bathing resort, but it is extremely dangerous,
for just a short distance from shore the bottom
seems to drop to a great depth. It is used
principally as a place for promenades and
dress show for the society folks, and every day
a long line of carriages wend their way out to
that pleasant little bit of beach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus13">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN ATTRACTIVE HOME, VIÑA DEL MAR.</p>
</div>

<p>The great attraction of Viña, however, is the
race course. Sunday is, of course, the gala
day, and the race course is crowded with lovers
of the sport. The people of Chile have passed
the bull-fight period in civilization, for the bull-fight
and lottery have both been banished by
statutory enactment, and the horse races have
taken their place. They vie with the residents
of Buenos Aires in their devotion to this sport.
The residents entertain house parties on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
day and all attend the track. They become
very enthusiastic, and few who have the money
neglect an opportunity to stake it on the horses,
for all are posted on the records of the various
animals listed in the races, and each one has
his or her favourite.</p>

<p>The province of Valparaiso does not extend
quite to the Cordilleras, but it does reach out
several hundred miles into the Pacific. Some
four hundred miles west of Valparaiso lies the
island of Juan Fernandez, which is generally
known among English-speaking people as Robinson
Crusoe’s Island.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Poor old Robinson Crusoe! Poor old Robinson Crusoe!</div>
<div class="verse">They made him a coat of an old Nanny goat,</div>
<div class="verse">I wonder how they could do so!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus runs the old nursery rhyme with which
all of us are familiar. There are few reading
people, young or old, who have not read that
fascinating tale of adventure, written by Daniel
Defoe, which depicts the adventures of Robinson
Crusoe. And yet, perhaps, there are
not so many who are familiar with the location
of the island which Defoe pretends to
describe.</p>

<p>The island of Juan Fernandez, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
known among Chileans as Mas-a-Tierra, is a
great mass of rock almost twelve miles long
by seven miles wide, a large part of which is
as barren as a desert. One side, however,
where fruits grow and the wild sheep and goats
find their sustenance, is covered with a luxuriant
vegetation. It is in a desolate location,
for it is away from the trade routes and there
are few vessels that pass that way. The fishing
boats that ply between Valparaiso and the
island keep up communication with the mainland.
The waters of the Pacific teem with fish,
and the fishermen have found the little bays of
this small island profitable waters for their
trade. It is a great lobster-fishing ground also,
and the largest lobsters by far that I ever have
seen were caught at this island.</p>

<p>Even to-day there are very few people who
live on the island of Juan Fernandez. Only
about half of it is fertile, and access to it is
so difficult that it does not appeal to many.
There is one settlement at San Juan Bautista—St.
John the Baptist—where the boats
land, and one or two other little groups of
houses where a few colonists live. The attempt
that has been made by the Chilean Government
to colonize it cannot be called a success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for fewer people live there to-day than
there did a few years ago.</p>

<p>Were it not for the story woven about the
island few people would be interested in it
to-day. It was here among these barren hills,
and in the natural caves which abound on the
island, that Alexander Selkirk lived for four
years and four months, more than two centuries
ago. It was here that he met and adopted
a lone Indian, whom he named Friday, because
of the day he first found him. It is little wonder
that existence was lonesome, and it is even
a greater wonder that he did not lose his mind
from lack of association with other human
beings. At last his watch fires attracted the
attention of a passing schooner and the lone
wanderer was taken to England, where, for a
time, he became quite a hero. He was found,
as the captain of the boat said, “clad in goat-skins
and was running about as though he were
demented.” There is a rock on the island
which is called “Robinson Crusoe’s Lookout,”
because it is said to be the place where the
signal fires were built. It is on a high hill and
commands a view of the sea for many miles.
A large cave, which is as large as the average
parlour, is supposed to have been his home. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the sides of this rock are rusty nails said to
have been driven into it by pirates who used
to make the place their rendezvous.</p>

<p>A marble tablet has been erected on the
“Lookout.” This was placed there by some
English naval officers in 1868, for Selkirk himself
was a naval officer. Among other things
this tablet says:</p>

<p class="center smcapuc">IN MEMORY OF<br />
<span class="larger">ALEXANDER SELKIRK</span><br />
MARINER.<br />
A NATIVE OF LARGO, IN THE COUNTY OF FIFE,<br />

<p class="center smcapuc">HE WAS LANDED FROM THE “CINQUE PORTS”<br />

<p class="center smcapuc">HE DIED LIEUTENANT OF H. M. S. “WEYMOUTH,” <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>,<br />

<p class="center smcapuc">THIS TABLET IS ERECTED NEAR SELKIRK’S LOOKOUT<br />
BY COMMODORE POWELL AND THE OFFICERS<br />
OF H. M. S. “TOPAZ” A. D., 1868.</p>

<p>Although Defoe’s tale is not wholly true,
and some of the descriptions are incorrect, yet
the story was suggested by the adventures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the marooned mariner, and the terrors of loneliness,
solitude and fear which overwhelmed
Robinson Crusoe were the same as those undergone
by Alexander Selkirk.</p>

<p>Pascua, or Easter, Island is situated considerably
farther out in the ocean than Juan Fernandez,
and farther north. It was so named
by a Dutch navigator, who landed on the island
on Easter morning, in 1722. He carried back
with him to Amsterdam the first record of
its strange monuments. The greatest length
of this island is eleven miles, and its greatest
breadth is four miles. Yet here on this little
speck in the ocean, an island no larger than
Manhattan Island, where the sun is warm both
summer and winter, and the climate is enervating,
at one time lived a strange and marvellous
people. None of the inhabitants of the
island at the time of its discovery knew anything
about the monuments or the race that
built them. The traditions which were handed
down from father to son shed no light on that
subject. Some claim that they were a race of
giants, evidently inspired by the gods whom
they worshipped. Others claim they were a
race that antedated the flood. There is also
a theory, based on these monuments and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
on other islands of the Polynesian Islands, that
this entire group were once a part of a continent
now submerged.</p>

<p>These people hauled mammoth stones from
quarries that face the sea, carved on them
faces and cut with rude implements upon all
the four sides the story they wanted to tell.
These stones were transported to chosen sites
and set up with engineering accuracy, until
almost the whole island became a gallery of
monumental sculpture. Then came a new era;
the race of builders disappeared, and no one
is now able to decipher the hieroglyphics. In
all there are over five hundred of these carved
statues, colossal heads and other samples of
the art of these prehistoric people. Except in
a few cases the monuments face the sea, and
to the east, and they range in size from a mammoth
monolith seventy feet in height to a
pigmy the size of a small boy. Some of them
weigh several tons and were transported from
quarries distant as much as eight miles. How
this was done without the aid of mechanical
devices is a mystery.</p>

<p>Besides the statues there are several immense
platforms constructed of large cut
stones piled together, as if they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shaped to conform to the plan of an architect,
and all are set with true edges without cement
and plaster. These platforms are about thirty
feet high, and from two hundred to three hundred
feet in length. After a fashion they look
like immense banquet tables or council platforms.
Around or upon these tables the prehistoric
chiefs may have sat in stone seats and
deliberated or made plans to conquer enemies.</p>

<p>On this island there are some peaks which
rise as high as twelve hundred feet above the
surface of the sea, and there are walls of stone
formed from lava which for scores of centuries
have lain there, and small lakes formed in
natural cups and bowls which were probably
once the open mouths of volcanoes. There are
the remains of what was once a house of stone.
As the tumbled blocks now lie they mark out
a structure one hundred feet long, twenty feet
wide, with walls five feet thick. Some of the
slabs are marked with geometrical figures and
with representations of animals and birds.
These suggest a gigantic species, larger than
any that exist to-day. In fact all their representations
of life suggest a heroic mould.
But the peculiar feature of this house is that
the ceiling was not more than five feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which would seem to render it unsuited for a
dwelling place. It might have been intended
for a storehouse of some sort. At the present
time there are only a few hundred people living
on the island who are of the Sawaiori race,
and resemble very strongly the natives of

<span class="smaller">THE CITY OF SAINT JAMES</span></h2>

<p>“We will call this city Santiago (Saint
James), for he has guided us thus far,” said
Pedro de Valdivia, as he staked out the level
ground surrounding a lofty rock into square
blocks, one of which was given to each of his
followers.</p>

<p>Few cities in the world have as fine a location
as this City of Saint James. It lies in
the centre of a magnificent amphitheatre, about
forty miles long and perhaps eighteen miles
wide, which is enclosed by a mighty wall of
mountains on all sides save one, half of which
are covered with perpetual snows. The Mapocho
River, which flows through the city
through an artificial channel, escapes from the
valley through the opening on the south, which
leads into the great central valley that forms
the real heart of the republic. The great
amphitheatre in which Santiago is situated is
divided into large <i>haciendas</i>, on which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
erected magnificent mansions that resemble
the ancient baronial homes of England. In
these the owners live and rule almost like lords
of old.</p>

<p>Santiago was founded as the first town in
Chile. Valdivia erected a stronghold on the
rock, which he named Santa Lucia, and then
set to work to build the city at its base, which
he had named after the patron saint of Spain.
The squares were laid out with the lines running
east and west, north and south. Each of
his followers to whom was given a square for a
garden, was required to construct a house for
his own use. Thus it will be seen that Santiago
is not a new city, nor has its growth been
of the mushroom variety. Founded in the sixteenth
century, it preserves in wood and stone,
to a great extent, the spirit of old Spain transplanted
to the New World. The Spanish cavalier
stalked in complete mail through the
streets of Santiago before the <i>Mayflower</i>
landed the pilgrims on the shores of Massachusetts.
The priests were chanting the solemn
service of the church here long before the
English landed at Jamestown. Dust had gathered
on the volumes in the municipal library
of this city centuries preceding the building of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the first little red school-house in the United
States. Before New York was even thought
of, the drama of life was being enacted daily
in this beautiful valley after Castilian models.</p>

<p class="caption">SANTA LUCIA.</p>
</div>

<p>But let us take a look at this ancient capital.
At one side of the city is El Cerro de Santa
Lucia, a mass of volcanic rock almost as high
as the Washington Monument. It has a base of
several acres, but gradually narrows as it rises
precipitously above all the buildings, until it
ends in the jagged piece of rock which crowns
the summit. After the fortress was removed
it became the burial place of Jews, Protestants,
infidels and all who were forbidden burial in
consecrated ground. When these bones were
finally removed they were dumped in a corner
of one of the Catholic cemeteries, and the
church authorities erected a monument with
the inscription “exiles from both heaven and
earth.” This freak of nature, which geologists
say was dropped by some wandering iceberg,
has been made into a delightful place, partly
by private subscription and partly at public
expense. The summit is reached by several
winding roads and walks that are enclosed by
walls in a most picturesque manner. In the
crevices of the rocks flowers, bushes and curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plants are growing. Eucalyptus trees rise
up, and gigantic ferns reach out so that the
hill seems a veritable garden in the air. At
intervals are kiosks for music or refreshments,
and half way up is a theatre where vaudeville
entertainments are occasionally given for the
entertainment of the people. Terraces, fountains,
winding walks and steps cut out of the
rock add to the beauties and comforts of Santa
Lucia. On the summit is a little chapel where
the remains of Mr. Benjamine Vicuña Mackenna,
who planned this scheme and gave large
sums towards its completion, lies buried. On
the way up one passes one wonderful rock formation
after another, delightful grottoes and
cozy nooks, until at last all Santiago is spread
out before you like a panorama.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ALAMEDA DE LAS DELICIAS, SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>Below is a vast expanse of flat roofs, out of
which here and there rise trees and a wealth
of green. These are in the patios, or inside
courts, of the larger houses. Here and there
rise the towers of the numerous churches with
which Santiago is provided. The many streets
cross each other in checkerboard fashion, thus
dividing the city into square blocks. At one
side can be distinguished the Alameda de las
Delicias, with its double rows of great poplar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
trees, which furnish an arbour of dense shade
from one end of the city to the other, a distance
of three miles, and which leads out to
the parks known as Quinta Normal and Cousiño.
This avenue, which was formerly the
principal road leading into the city, has been
laid out as a broad highway more than three
hundred feet in width, with a promenade in
the centre and a wide driveway on either side.
Fronting this Alameda are many very fine
residences—the finest in the city. Some of
the houses are very large, containing fifty
rooms or more, and the furnishings are elaborate.
The ceilings are very high, which gives
ample opportunity for decorative effect. One
striking feature is the absence of chimneys, for
the Chileans are averse to artificial heat. In
the winter time it is nothing unusual for a
guest to be received by the host and his family
wearing furs and heavy wraps. A few of the
newer houses have installed heating plants.
With these homes the best and most attractive
part is usually hidden from the street. There
are several stands along the Alameda at which
military bands discourse music frequently.
The promenade is broken by many statues of
Chile’s heroes, and others commemorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
events important in Chilean history; and at
every few feet throughout its length are stone
seats on which the people rest.</p>

<p>One of the finest private residences in South
America is that belonging to the Cousiño family,
which was erected by the late Señora Isadora
Cousiño. It was designed by a famous
French architect and will compare favourably
with those of New York. It is built of brick,
stuccoed in the usual manner to resemble stone,
and is imposing. Its interior decorations are
elaborate, but rather the style one would expect
in a public building than in a private
home. They are all French scenes, as the work
was done by French artists. It is still one of
the show places, although the señora has been
dead for many years, and her descendants have
more modest taste. She was a remarkable
woman, and her chief concern seemed to be to
expend her enormous income. Her extravagance
was frequently the gossip of Europe as
well as her native land. Herself the richest
woman in Chile before marriage, she married
the richest man, and all his wealth was willed
to her at his death. She had millions of dollars
in herds, mines, railroads, steamships, real
estate, etc. Another magnificent château at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Lota was built by her, and the <i>estancia</i> of
Macul, an hour’s ride from Santiago, was
almost a principality in itself. The land
stretched from the environs of the city to the
distant Cordilleras with their mantle of snow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus16">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="650" height="360" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DANCING LA CUECA, THE NATIONAL DANCE.</p>
</div>

<p>Señora Cousiño did one good thing for Santiago;
she presented to the city beautiful Cousiño
Park. It is a large park of several hundred
acres, which is the popular playground of
the masses. It has cheap cafés, merry-go-rounds
and other amusements, and is the nearest
approach to a Coney Island that the capital
affords. There are a number of stands for
dancing where, on a Sunday especially, one
may see the Chilean national dance, La Cueca,
which is a sort of refined can-can. The couples
pair off with handkerchiefs in their hands, and
dance face to face, while the musicians sit on
benches near-by and thrum guitars, pick mandolins,
or play other instruments. Each
dancer waves his handkerchief in the air with
graceful gestures, and sways around in attitudes
which are supposed to show grace and
suppleness. A race track has also been constructed
in the centre of the park, called the
“Club Hippico,” where races are held almost
every Sunday afternoon and frequently on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
holidays. This is the most popular amusement
in Chile. Another park, the Quinta Normal,
has been provided for the people, and in it is
quite an extensive zoological garden. Among
the many “strange” and “fierce” animals
kept in cages are several species of dogs and
cats, which seem very much out of place in such
surroundings. A very interesting museum
also occupies a pretty site near the entrance.
A botanical garden and experiment station is
also maintained here, and an exposition building
in which agricultural fairs are held each
year.</p>

<p>There are a number of very fine public
buildings in Santiago. Perhaps the finest is
the Palace of Congress, which is a large building
of modern classical construction covering
an entire square—not differing much from
many public buildings that one will find in the
United States. I attended a session of the
Senate and the proceedings seemed very
strange. The members talked at random without
even addressing the chair or rising from
their seats. In fact the proceedings were the
most informal of any legislative body I ever
attended. Not infrequently, however, the sessions
are very stormy, and the reputation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Spaniard for excitability is well maintained.
The National Library is almost opposite
this building, but is not an imposing building,
although it contains an interesting and
valuable collection of books. La Moneda is the
name given to the residence of the President,
and it also contains the offices of many of the
government departments. It is a large three-story
building with quite imposing surroundings.
The President is generally attended by
a military guard during his drives around the
city. Other buildings are the Palace of Justice,
in which the highest courts sit, the Army
Building, and the Intendency, or City Hall.</p>

<p>At one place in Santiago a beautiful marble
monument has been erected on the site of a
church that was burned in 1863. Church festivals
have always played an important part in
the social life of the capital. At the time of the
Christmas festivities of that year a gorgeous
<i>fête</i> was in progress in the Jesuits’ church,
which was known as the Feast of the Virgins.
The interior was festooned and decorated
everywhere with light gauze, wreaths of paper
flowers and other inflammable material. Candles
had been attached to these flimsy decorations.
The church was crowded with women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
while high mass was being celebrated by the
bishop. Suddenly the hangings caught fire, the
burning candles fell among the crowd of worshippers
and everyone rushed for the doors.
As usual, the doors opened inward, and the
crowds, jammed against them, made it impossible
for them to be opened. It is claimed that
almost three thousand women and girls lost
their lives in this terrible holocaust. After the
fire the bodies were found packed in a solid
mass against the doors. The church was afterwards
razed to the ground by order of the government,
and this monument erected on the site.
Scarcely a leading family in Santiago escaped
bereavement, and the Feast of the Virgins has
ever since been celebrated with mourning in
Chile.</p>

<p>There are many worthy charitable institutions
in Santiago. Some of these are municipal
institutions and others are church charities.
Among these are numerous hospitals for
the care of the sick and unfortunate. There
is one very large orphan asylum, which cares
for many hundreds of unfortunate children—many
of them of unknown parentage. The
method of reception of these unfortunate, and
generally unwelcome, infants is unique. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rear wall is an opening with a wooden box in
it which swings in and out. The mother wishing
to get rid of her baby places the little mite
in the box and swings it in. The automatic
ringing of a bell notifies the nuns inside and
the baby is taken charge of by them. No effort
is ever made to find the mother, and she is thus
enabled to rid herself of her charge. Some
moralists would criticize this practice, but it is
certainly better than infanticide, which is said
to be an almost unknown crime in Chile, where
the ratio of illegitimate births is very large.</p>

<p>The Opera House is a municipal institution
and is a very fine building. During the season
opera is given here several nights each week,
and generally by Italian companies. Not only
is the building furnished free, but a good subsidy
is given the management each year in
order to bring good talent here. The seats and
boxes are sold by subscription for the season
as a guaranty fund and are paid for in advance,
although many sell their seats occasionally
if there is a demand for them. The audiences
are very interesting, for the people dress
exceedingly well and are lavish in their wearing
of jewels. There is a large foyer in which
the people promenade between acts and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are refreshment rooms where all kinds of refreshments
are served. A special box is reserved
for the President of the republic and
the <i>intendente</i> of the city. There is also a
mourning box protected by screens, where those
in mourning may watch the performance without
being themselves seen.</p>

<p>The city of Santiago is a municipality within
the province of the same name. A little more
democracy has been infused into the government
than used to prevail. The city is divided
into ten sections or wards. Each of these
wards, called <i>circumscripciones</i>, elects three
councillors, all the members together constituting
the municipal legislative body. They
must be citizens of at least five years’ residence
in the city, must not have any interest in national
or municipal contracts, and must not
hold any other public office or commission.
The three members from each ward have certain
local powers and duties principally in connection
with the elections. From its members
the council elect three alcaldes, or mayors, fixing
the order of precedence among the three,
also a secretary and treasurer. The powers
and jurisdiction of this body extends to the
entire government, subject only to the constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the organic act under which the
municipality is organized. The principal revenues
are derived from a personal tax levied
for school purposes, a tax on liquors and tobacco,
a license for industries and professions,
revenues derived from city property and an
annual grant from the national Congress.</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUP OF NEWSBOYS, SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>It is in the market-places that one can best
study the common people. There are two
markets in Santiago, both of them on the bank
of the Mapocho. At the newer one one will
be sure to find some newsboys plying their
trade. “<i>La Union</i>” and “<i>El Mercurio</i>” are
the cries of these busy little newsboys, as they
flit in and out among the marketers of Santiago.
They are barefooted ragamuffins, most of
them, but they industriously ply their trade.
Their complexions are of different shades, for
some of the boys have Indian blood in their
veins, which gives them a deeper colouring. I
posed two small boys for a picture, but before
I could take it a half dozen had crowded into
it, making an interesting group. The boys of
South America, just like their counterparts in
the United States, want to take a part in everything
that comes within their range of vision.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
place in Santiago than the old market,
which will soon be abandoned. Around it will
be seen the huge, two-wheeled market carts in
which the produce has been brought. Many of
these marketers have been on the road for two
or three days, bringing in the products of their
fertile fields for the people in the city. The
meek-eyed oxen stand or recline while chewing
their cud, no doubt enjoying to the full the
brief respite from their work. The produce
displayed in the market is good. The fruits
of Chile are simply delicious in flavour, and
they are large in size. The pears and peaches
of California are not better than those grown
here below the equator, and yet they have been
grown with very little care in their cultivation.</p>

<p>One must bargain with or pay an exorbitant
price to these market men and women. If it
is only a melon, or a dozen juicy pears, twice
as much will be asked as is expected. If you
shake your head when a price is given, the man
or woman in charge of the stall will immediately
ask, “What will you give?” On the
outside of the market building dozens of
women will be seen seated on the ground with
a little pile of tomatoes, radishes, potatoes or
melons heaped up in front of them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
housewife or servant will pass around among
them making purchases and gradually filling
up the basket which she carries, or hires some
boy to bear for her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus18">

<p class="caption">A MARKET SCENE, SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>The poorer Chileans are a hard working
people—the most industrious of the South
Americans. A walk through the sections of
the city occupied by them shows much grinding
poverty. Across the Mapocho penury
stretches on all sides. The dwellings are low,
with floors oftentimes below the street level,
and the interiors show unsanitary conditions
and an entire lack of the comforts of life, let
alone the decencies. The improvement of such
surroundings should command immediate attention
from the authorities. The wages paid
this class are not very large, so that they are
compelled to live in comparative poverty.
They drink a great deal on Sundays and holidays.
Monday is a bad day to get anything
done, for the peons must have a few hours to
recover from the previous day’s celebration.
It is a sort of a “<i>dias non</i>,” a day that is not.
Holidays are greatly desired, and it takes five
of them to properly celebrate the “diaz y ocho
de Setiembre,” the 18th of September, the anniversary
of Chilean independence. <i>Fiestas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
are held in every park and plaza, and all the
banks and business houses close. Everybody,
young and old, engages in the festivities with
zeal and enthusiasm. The poor people save
up their money for weeks and months in order
to celebrate this occasion in the only way that
seems appropriate to them—that is, by carousing.
Saturday is beggars’ day, and every
mendicant in the city is out with open palm.
On other days only the licensed beggars appear.
Some beggars even come out on horseback,
for horses are remarkably cheap in
Chile.</p>

<p>Another good view may be had of the poorer
classes on the occasion of a church celebration,
such as the festival of Corpus Christi. Both
church and state take a part in this <i>fiesta</i>.
The troops appear in their finest uniforms.
The infantry are gorgeous in their blue and
yellow, with helmets surmounted with white
plumes. The cavalry wear blue plumes and
the bands are adorned with red plumes. The
religious procession consists of the Procession
of the Cross, which is composed of various
societies, the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians
and other orders. The parochial clergy
follow with the Archbishop in the lead. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the procession hundreds of women and children,
and some men, kneel in the streets. Some
men doff their hats, while others look on in
seemingly idle curiosity without any special
attitude of reverence.</p>

<p>The wealthier people take life easy. The
real life is only for this class. After breakfast,
which is served from eleven to twelve o’clock,
comes the siesta. This meal is frequently an
elaborate and formal function if guests are
present, and is more like a dinner. On the door
of many business houses one will see the sign
“<i>cerrado de las 12 a 1½ horas</i>,” which means
that they are closed between these hours.
Business calls are usually made between two
and four. At six o’clock every person who
owns or can hire a carriage goes out to Cousiño
Park. Everyone dresses in his best, the
men wearing silk hats and frock suits, and the
women having on fashionable gowns and large
hats. In the park the carriages parade up and
down the principal drives and the occupants
nod to their acquaintances. It is quite the correct
thing for men to make audible remarks
about the personal appearance of ladies, if they
are complimentary. After about half an hour
of this parade they adjourn as by mutual consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to the Alameda, which is twice as wide
as Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, and
the parade continues up one side of the imposing
avenue and down the other for another
half hour. There are all kinds of vehicles—drays,
victorias, landaus, four-in-hands and automobiles.
The driving is superintended by
mounted policemen, and the scene is quite imposing,
though rather stilted in the eyes of an
American. The parade then breaks up and all
drive home to partake of the dinner, which is
the principal meal of the day. The politeness
of the Chileno is excessive. He will always
give the lady the inner side of the street, and
would cheerfully step off the sidewalk in order
to render this courtesy. The man always extends
the first greeting also to a lady of his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Club life is greatly enjoyed in Santiago, for
the resident of that city is very much of a
night-hawk. The Club de la Union is the best
club in the country. It was my privilege to
be entertained there a number of times. The
real life does not begin until rather late, and
there is always a representative crowd of men
to be found there after ten o’clock, and gambling
is sure to be indulged in in some form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
While the men are at the club the women stay
at home, or attend the theatre.</p>

<p>When Italian opera is not being given, one-act
comedies are the favourite plays. Going
to the theatre, however, usually means looking
in for a <i>zarzuela</i> or two during the evening.
Three or four of these one-act pieces, or <i>zarzuelas</i>,
are usually put on in an evening, and
the house is cleared after each performance.
Those who dine late usually drop in for the
second turn, which begins about half-past nine;
or one can catch the last one, which does not
begin until about eleven o’clock. Some of
these <i>zarzuelas</i> are one-act musical plays,
abridged from popular operas, but most of
them are melodrama or grotesque comedy.
The audiences are very alert and are quick to
respond to appeals from the stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>Mamacita</i>, let us go around the plaza
once more, for the band has not yet quit playing,”
plead the little girls and young ladies
of Santiago. On Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday
evenings a band plays in the Plaza de
Armas, which is the centre of life and business
in the Chilean capital. Then occurs the <i>paseo</i>,
or promenade, so common in Spanish towns.
It usually begins before the light has yet faded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from the highest peaks of the Andes, and while
the newsboys are still calling out “<i>Las Ultimas
Noticias</i>.” The girls and young ladies,
the boys and young men, all come here on these
evenings. The former are always accompanied
by their mothers, as the social customs are
very strict and the girls do not enjoy as much
freedom as their cousins have in North America.
The mothers sit on the benches, while
the younger women and girls walk around the
plaza in pairs and groups. The young men,
among whom are many officers in German uniforms
and with clanking swords, walk around
in the opposite direction, and pass audible comments
on the girls who pass. Their remarks
are irritating to an Anglo-Saxon who understands
the Castilian lisp, but the girls only
laugh or smile, for they are quite accustomed
to it. The same attentions bestowed on young
ladies on the average American street would
result in an interference by a man in blue uniform,
and possibly a gentle use of the “big
stick.” The young men exchange a few words
with those with whom they are acquainted, but
not for long, for mamma keeps her vigilant
eyes on them. The girls, even little tots, are
finished coquettes, and they aim to attract attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
This is one of the few opportunities
afforded to the young people to see each other.
If a young man observes a girl by whom he is
attracted he will begin inquiries as to who she
is, and perhaps even his folks will aid him in
his effort to make the acquaintance of his inamorata.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLDEST BUILDING IN SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>Within almost a stone’s throw of the Plaza
is all of Chile—those who rule and those who
own—the principal club, theatres, public
buildings and residences of diplomats. The
chief business streets converge at this plaza,
and the leading business houses are near it.
The great cathedral and archbishop’s palace
occupy one entire side, the post office and a
government building another side, and the portales,
or corridors, under which are many
booths and stores, fill up the remaining two
sides. The stores around the plaza are small
and like those of old Spain. This is the oldest
business section in Santiago and was in existence
two centuries before our own national
capital. Some of the stores are like holes in
the wall, with goods stacked up in the doorway
and even on the street outside. They are far
different from the larger and more modern
establishments near the corner of Ahumada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and Huerfanos, a block away. There one will
find splendid stores where goods from all parts
of the world can be purchased. A fine large
department store has recently been opened up
in the city, which is a great improvement over
any of the old establishments. The prices in
the windows look very high, but an article
marked five dollars means only about one-fifth
that amount in United States currency.</p>

<p>During the day many shoppers may be seen.
The women trip along two by two or roll up
in their broughams, victorias or automobiles.
In the morning the women wear black gowns
and the <i>mantas</i>, which are shawls folded into
a sort of bonnet which gives a very demure
setting to the black-eyed, oval, and, oftentimes,
beautiful faces underneath. This is the dress
worn to the morning mass, and is not changed
until after the breakfast hour. One may sometimes
see the roguish eyes of the wearer peering
at him from beneath this <i>manta</i>, even while
the owner is fingering her beads and uttering
her prayers in the cathedral. Some one has
described the <i>manta</i> as “that graceful euphemism
which shields the poor and disarms
the vain, hides bad taste and clumsy waists,
and wrapped about the head and nipped in in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some marvellous fashion at the nape of the
neck, envelops all femininity in gracefulness
and mystery.”</p>

<p>One’s visit is not complete without seeing a
sunset from Santa Lucia. Santiago is situated
in a valley, surrounded by lofty mountains on
every side. At its back are the Cordilleras of
the Andes, with their lofty peaks which lift
their eternal snows far up into the blue ethereal
canopy overhead. As the sun creeps
slowly into the western sky it illumes the red
tile roof of the city and the many spires. Then
its rays fall full upon the snow-clad peaks, and
long after the fiery ball has dropped behind the
lower range of mountains, which separate
Santiago from the sea, its rays continue to
glisten upon the loftier peaks that form the
eastern horizon. Then, as darkness slowly
falls over the landscape, the electric lights of
the city flash forth beneath you like visions in
fairy land. The whole scene, with its variations
and transformations, is one that will long
linger in memory.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GRANARY OF THE REPUBLIC</span></h2>

<p>The heart of Chile lies in the great central
valley which extends south from Santiago,
through Concepción and beyond, for a distance
of almost six hundred miles. It lies between
the Andes and the less lofty range of
mountains that follows the coast line. This
used to be Chile almost, but the development
of the nitrate industry to the north has made
that section of much greater importance than
formerly. The climate in this valley is delightful,
neither too cold nor too wet, and its
nearness to the charms of the capital has made
it an attractive dwelling place for the Chilenos
for several centuries. The climate is very similar
to that of California. The same crops and
fruits are raised in both places, and the conditions
of farming are also very much the
same.</p>

<p>After leaving Santiago the railroad passes
through numerous orchards and extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
vineyards which grow around this proud city.
Over the fences of mud and stone trail the
branches of peach trees, and along the roads
stretch eternal rows of solemn poplars and
stiff clumps of the eucalyptus. The waters of
the Maipo ripple along near the track. There
is an appearance of enterprise and industry
everywhere. Great carts drawn by oxen, some
of them with solid wheels like those of Pharaoh’s
time, are lined up at every station, as
well as pack mules awaiting their burdens. As
a contrast a luxurious French or Italian automobile
may be seen. Fine <i>estancia</i> buildings
surrounded by vineyards loom up prominently
along the route, while, as a contrast, are the
rude buildings inhabited by the peons, which
show absolutely no advance over centuries ago.
There is the same contrast in farming methods.
Rude ploughs which merely scratch the ground
may be seen at work nearer to outfits which are
strictly modern.</p>

<p>The valley varies in its outline, for in places
the surrounding mountains press in and diminish
its width. Numerous streams which have
their origin in the Andes cut across it, and
their milky-white waters restlessly rush onward
to the sea. Among these are the Cachopoal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Maraquito, the Bueno, the Maule and the
Claro (clear), whose waters are more transparent
than the others. The altitude becomes
lower and the temperature correspondingly
warmer. On the eastern side the lofty volcanoes
of Maipo and its companions are plainly
in sight. Cattle may be seen grazing on the
rougher lands, while great fields of wheat and
other grains grow in the more tillable portions.
At the stations farther down girls, who
show by the darkened complexion their admixture
with the Indians, offer baskets of all
shapes and sizes, from one the size of a pea,
to the passengers as souvenirs. In this admixture
the natives have conquered the would-be
conquerors.</p>

<p>One of the most important places passed
is Talca, which is one of the largest cities of
Chile. It has plenty of rainfall and is surrounded
by wheat farms. It has a very pretty
plaza, and is ornamented with some statuary
brought from Peru at the time of the war with
that country. Two snow-clad volcanoes lift
their hoary heads to the skies on the eastern
horizon, although at a considerable distance.
It is situated at a distance of about one hundred
and fifty miles from the capital. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
streets are many of them lined with poplars,
and magnolia trees lend their fragrance. Vegetables
and fruits grown here are of the finest,
and the inhabitants of Talca are able to live
on the good things of life after approved fashion.</p>

<p>As old as is this valley, there is still much
undeveloped land in it. This land is partly
covered with the bramble or other scrub
growth. The only trees to be seen for hundreds
of miles are those that have been
planted. Some of the soil is very rich, while
some is stony and hard to cultivate. Where
irrigation has been developed the soil responds
readily to the hand of the agriculturalist. The
silt carried down from the mountains by the
streams acts as a fertilizer when deposited on
the surface of the valley. South of the Bio-Bio
River no irrigation is employed, or is necessary.
The coast range gradually becomes
lower until it disappears. Evergreen trees
take the place of the common forms of deciduous
trees. The Rio Itata is quite an important
stream, but all the rivers of this valley
fade in importance by the side of the famous
Bio-Bio. Up to 1884 this river was the frontier
boundary, all the land beyond being under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the sway of the Araucanian Indians, who were
a sturdy and independent tribe. Many battles
have been fought near this stream with the
Indians, who resisted Spain and the succeeding
republic for more than three hundred
years. The iron horse has now crossed it and
opened up the regions beyond, although all of
the southern section has a much newer appearance
than that on the other side of the river.
The newer towns remind one very much of the
frontier communities in the United States.
Many of them are settlements of Europeans,
and some of them have had hard struggles for
existence. Onward the route leads through
Victoria, Temuco, and Valdivia to Puerto
Montt, a port and the last town of any importance
until Punta Arenas is reached. It is
also beyond what might be termed the valley
proper. Nearly all of this region is extremely
fertile, and contains some of the richest land
in the republic. It only needs irrigation in the
north, and a clearing of the forests in the
southern portions, to make it blossom with
wheat and other valuable grains for the support
of mankind. From the orange groves of
Santiago to the apple orchards of Temuco this
valley ought to be one immense garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus20">

<p class="caption">A PLANTATION OWNER.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>This great central valley is parcelled out
among large landowners, many of whom own
almost princely estates. As agriculture has
always been the chief occupation of the Chilenos,
fully one-half of the population being engaged
in it, these estates have been held in the
same family for generations in many instances.
A farm of a thousand acres is small, and there
are many which number thirty or forty thousand
acres. Upon the product of these broad
acres the owner lives in luxury almost like the
feudal lords of old. Hundreds of peons work
on the <i>haciendas</i>, just as their forefathers did
before them, and they really form a small army
of retainers, who used to be ready to fight the
battles of the <i>hacendado</i> at a moment’s call.
Now they work for them for small wages, and
are always in debt. So long as they are indebted
to the master they can be compelled
to remain and work it out.</p>

<p>Irrigation has been considerably developed
in some parts. Each <i>hacendado</i> is a subscriber
to or shareholder in an irrigation canal. These
have been constructed at a great expense and
are protected by very strict laws. They consist
of main canals starting well up among the
hills, and are pierced by many small outlets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
called <i>regadores</i>. Each of these has an outlet
of a fixed number of litres per second. The
fields are traversed by parallel and intersecting
smaller channels, and the water is thus conducted
from place to place. Movable dams of
canvas stop the flow into these intersecting
channels, so that the amount flowing can be
regulated as the needs require.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus21">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DRAWING AN AMERICAN THRESHER.</p>
</div>

<p>It is seldom that one will see fences of wire
or boards, for most of the estates are hemmed
in with walls of stone. The absence of barns
on the landscape is a striking feature, and the
only buildings of any size are the low, rambling
structures which form the residence of the
<i>hacendado</i>, his <i>administrador</i>, and other heads.
These usually consist of one-storied buildings,
which are built around a central <i>patio</i>, and
have wide porches floored with brick. The
<i>patios</i> are laid out in pretty little gardens, in
which the palm is sure to have its part in the
attempt at ornamentation. Great avenues of
lofty trees usually run out in every direction
along the roads or irrigation channels. The
most of the estates are fairly well kept, for
the Chileans are quite progressive agriculturalists.
One will find on many of these great
farms the very latest of farming implements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
including steam or gasoline tractors for certain
phases of the work. Especially is this
true of their harvesting machinery, which includes
the latest North American patterns.
But in one respect there are some antiquated
features, and that is in transportation. If animal
power is employed it is almost invariably
oxen, and not horses or mules. They plough
the ground, haul the timber, and behind them
the thousands of bushels of grain produced in
this valley are conveyed to market. These
animals are yoked by the horns, which seems
a very cruel way to treat these humble but
faithful servants of man. It looks to the onlooker
as though every jar of the great carts
must give pain to the oxen, and oftentimes
their eyes seem almost darting from their
heads.</p>

<p>The vineyards of this valley cover thousands
of acres, for the Chileans drink wine as the
Germans drink beer. A meal without the white
or red contents of a long-necked bottle would
be incomplete. The vines are dwarfed, and are
planted in rows five or six feet apart. In many
cases they are trained upon wires, and the
vineyards are not unlike those in some parts
of France. The abundance of a certain species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of snail is said to be one of the worst enemies
of vitaculture. The Chilean wines, both red
and white, have quite a reputation, and the
exports are increasing each year.</p>

<p>The abundance of dogs about these Chilean
<i>haciendas</i> impresses the traveller. The Chilenos
are very fond of these animals, and everybody
seems to keep many of them. Most of
them are obliged to forage for a living. They
naturally become rather unsavoury scavengers
under such circumstances. It is not advisable
to approach a farm, especially at night, without
being accompanied by some one connected
with the place, as the dogs seem to consider
it their duty to protect the household from
intrusion. Furthermore, the people living
there are free to fire at any unauthorized person,
because of the prevalence of petty thieving.</p>

<p>Temuco is at a distance of a little less than
five hundred miles from Santiago. It is situated
on the Cautin River, and is the capital
of the province of that name. Only thirty
years old, this city already has a population
of twelve thousand, and covers about as much
space as an American town of the same size.
Like an American town, also, its houses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
mostly of wood, a striking contrast to the older
towns, farther down the valley toward the capital.
Although the temperature becomes quite
cold here at times the houses are built without
chimneys, for the people believe that fires are
unhealthful. Churches, clubs and hotels have
been built, and there are saloons where almost
pure alcohol is dished out to the poor
peons.</p>

<p>Back into the wilderness from here and other
places the government has pushed short spurs
of railroads in order to open it up. The government
locates the stations and lays out the
lots, which are sold at low prices to actual settlers.
The lands round about are sold at auction
in good sized blocks of fifteen hundred
acres or more. This land will bring from one
to twelve dollars per hectare (about two and
a quarter acres). A farm of two thousand
acres of choice land could probably be secured
for five thousand dollars in United States currency.
The sales are generally made upon the
basis of one-third cash, and the balance is distributed
over a period of years. The only provision
exacted by the government is that the
purchaser must fence in his newly-acquired
possessions, but this is oftentimes a great expense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
This land when heavily stocked with
cattle is said to yield very good returns.</p>

<p>A few years ago every new immigrant was
promised one hundred acres of land, a team
of oxen, a barrel of nails and enough boards
to build a small house. He was also advanced
the money necessary for his transportation.
All of this had to be repaid, however, and the
land alone was the only actual gift. Under
these terms many Germans were induced to
come to this land of promise. Many of these
settlers have done well, and some towns, such
as Valdivia and Puerto Montt, are largely German
cities.</p>

<p>The first German settlers arrived about
1850, and they continued to come in considerable
numbers for the next decade. The first
emigrants arrived in the German barque <i>Hermann</i>,
after a journey of one hundred and
twenty days from Hamburg. She brought
seventy men, ten women and five children.
They had been lured by the promises of an
immigration agent who described the country
as flowing with milk and honey. When they
arrived everything was in hopeless confusion,
for titles were uncertain and the country was
an almost unbroken forest. The colonists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
began work under these discouraging conditions
and the face of the country soon showed
alteration. Puerto Montt was founded, and a
good road built through the trackless and
swampy woodland to Lake Llanquihue. The
influx of Germans has continued even to this
day, and many will be found who can speak no
other tongue than that of the Vaderland.</p>

<p>On the journey from Santiago to Puerto
Montt no less than a dozen provinces are
passed. Many of these are comparatively
small, such as O’Higgins, which is about the
size of Delaware, to Llanquihue, which corresponds
with our own state of Indiana. Most
of them run from the Andes to the coast, but
Arauco and Maule are purely coast provinces.
The names of the provinces in this section, and
their order beginning with the one adjoining
the province of Santiago, are as follows:—O’Higgins,
Colchagua, Curico, Talca, Maule,
Linares, Nuble, Concepción, Bio-Bio, Arauco,
Malleco, Cautin, Valdivia, and Llanquihue.</p>

<p>Along the coast between Puerto Montt and
Valparaiso are several ports of more or less
importance. Among these are Constitucion,
situated at the mouth of the River Talcahuano,
and Coronel. The latter is the Newcastle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Chile, for it is in the midst of many coal mines.
Many of these mines run out under the Pacific
for long distances. The seams of coal are from
three to five feet thick. They are under a
strata of slate and shale, which is so compact
as to be absolutely water-tight. It is a strange
experience to run out in these mines, which
form a veritable catacomb of corridors and
chambers, and realize that perhaps at that very
moment some of the great ocean steamers are
majestically sailing the blue waters directly
over you. I know of no similar mines except
those of Whitehaven, England, where the galleries
run out several miles under the sea and
seem to be headed for the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Lota is also another mining town on this
same bay, and is a town of about fifteen thousand
people. This city and Coronel are really
twin ports. Lota was founded by Matias Cousiño,
who opened up the mines and established
smelter works in 1855. The company owns a
large amount of property and employs several
thousand men. It furnishes huts, free medical
attendance, a church, schools and a hospital for
its employees. The sight of this town is the
wonderful palace built by his widow, which
was constructed at a cost of many thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of dollars. It is a <i>château</i> of white Italian
marble, and stands in the centre of a French
landscape garden. There are ravines, fountains,
statuary, arbours, terraces, grottoes, artificial
lakes and a small zoological exhibit on
the grounds. It blends French and English
landscape gardening with some original ideas.
Few country homes in Europe can compare
with it. It is said that all the material was
brought from France in the Señora Doña Isadora
Goyenecheo de Cousiño’s own ships, and
the interior is adorned with fine furniture and
decorations by famous French artists. Cousiño
Park at Lota has become the pride of
Chile.</p>

<p>By far the most important town is Concepción,
also in the coal district, and which is
known as the southern capital. It has had
many serious struggles with the Indians, gaunt
famine and the still more terrible earthquake.
It is really a fine city of about fifty thousand
inhabitants. The last serious earthquake occurred
in 1835, when nearly the whole town
was destroyed. It is situated on the banks of
the Bio-Bio River, and has for its port Talcahuano
at the mouth of that river. Talcahuano
has a splendid harbour, and is better protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
than Valparaiso, as it is sheltered by the island
of Quiriquina. Whaling ships now leave it for
the Antarctic seas and bring back considerable
oil and whalebone. There is a factory here for
the manufacture and refining of whale oil. It
is the Chilean Annapolis, as it is the principal
naval harbour, with arsenals and dockyards,
and is also the site of a naval school. It will
eventually be the Pacific terminus of a transcontinental
railroad running to Bahia Blanca,
in Argentina.</p>

<p>Concepción is the supply centre of Southern
Chile, and does a large wholesale business as
well as some manufacturing on a small scale.
Quite a foreign colony is found there, and there
are as good clubs and hotels as in Valparaiso,
its northern rival. It has forgotten all about
earthquakes and has risen above its former disasters.
It is arranged very much as other
Chilean cities. There is an alameda bordered
with poplars, and there is a plaza. Lord Cochrane
(pronounced Coch-rah-ne by the Chileans),
and Admiral O’Higgins are remembered
in the nomenclature of the streets. You can
sit under municipal vines and fig-trees, or the
pear or cherry loaded with blossoms, if you
happen to be there in September. The markets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
are overflowing with fine vegetables, such as
cauliflower, lettuce, artichokes, carrots, radishes,
potatoes, cabbage, etc., etc. Indian faces
are very numerous at the market and on the
streets. Bands play two or three nights in the
week and the music is good. The flat plain on
which the town is situated is not especially
beautiful, but it gives unlimited opportunity
for growth, and the Bio-Bio, especially when
at flood, is an impressive stream. The galvanized
iron used so extensively in construction
does not add much to the beauty of the town.
As Southern Chile develops, Concepción becomes
of greater and greater importance, and
it has a steady and healthy increase each year.</p>

<p>Osorno is a thriving city a little ways inland
on a branch of the Rio Bueno, and was a place
of considerable importance in the Spanish
days. Corral is at the mouth of the river that
leads back to Valdivia, a dozen miles inland.
It has a trade of considerable importance with
the other ports, and is distant from Valparaiso
almost five hundred miles. The coast is not so
densely wooded as farther south, and the tide
is not more than one-fourth as high on the
average. Puerto Montt is a prosperous and
progressive little town situated on Reloncavi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Bay. It has a well protected harbour and enjoys
a considerable trade in lumber, wheat and
leather. The lofty Andes are plainly visible
on a clear day, especially the volcano Cabulco,
which is only twenty-two miles distant. A half
century ago this port had a commerce of considerable
value and was even then exporting
food products, although its population did not
much exceed a couple of thousand.</p>

</div>

<p>There are innumerable islands, which lie
close to the mainland, from Puerto Montt to
the Fuegian Archipelago. The largest of these
is Chiloé, which is a hundred miles long by
from thirty to fifty miles in width. It is generally
considered to be one of the sloppiest
islands in the world, for that was the reputation
the naturalist Darwin gave it, and his
opinion has been corroborated many times. Its
length runs parallel to the mainland, from
which it is separated by a quite broad bay.
The shores are generally wild and rather inhospitable.
If one lands any place, excepting
where a settler is located, the dense growth
will be found almost impenetrable, with all
branches dripping with moisture, and only an
occasional sunbeam being able to push its way
through the openings in the evergreen shrubbery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Moss-covered bogs abound in which one
may sink to the waist in the mire. On this
moist land everything grows with wonderful
rapidity that does not require a great amount
of sunshine. Moss, yards in length, and of
great delicacy and beauty, hangs from the
branches, while ferns and polypodia scramble
up the trunks. Beautifully scalloped lichens,
in brown and gold and lavender, decorate the
fallen trees wherever they can take hold, and
fungi covers the larger trees. Tough-fibred
climbers of great length also decorate the trees.
They are oftentimes employed to tie up the
fences instead of nails, and are also used in
weaving some of the beautiful baskets made
by the natives. Brooms made of it are likewise
exported. This dense growth abounds
everywhere, with the exception of barren pampas
which sometimes stretch for a quarter of
a mile or so. Cattle will sometimes wander
into these thick meshes, and no one but an Indian
accustomed to the tangle can penetrate
with anything like facility in their efforts to
find the recalcitrant animals.</p>

<p>Several thousand Indians dwell on this large
island. They have been semi-civilized for two
or three centuries. They seem to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
less warlike than the Araucanians on the mainland.
Their clothing is modelled somewhat
after that of the <i>rotos</i>, for nearly all sport a
white cotton or linen shirt, which is oftentimes
worn under the gaily-coloured indigo-dyed
<i>poncho</i>. The shoes are generally simply made
of a piece of raw oxhide fastened to the feet
with thongs of leather. Their houses are the
very simplest of contrivances. The family that
starves does so only through indifference.
Land is cheap and nature productive. Most
of them live near the seacoast or rivers, where
fish are very abundant, and edible wild-fowl of
many kinds, including ducks, geese and pigeons,
are easy to capture. The forests yield a
number of wild fruits and vegetables. Among
the wild fruits may be mentioned strawberries
of a delicious flavour, and a species of myrtle
which bears a palatable berry. The fruit of
the luma, or kow-chow, is very abundant, and
is used in making a fermented liquor much
used by the natives. They have remained as
poor as when the Spaniards came, and the population
has actually decreased in the last century.
This island, as well as others, was a
feudal holding and the tyranny of the proprietors
and abuses of the merchants account for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that. Justice and humanity were frequently
unknown terms. Churches are not wanting,
for at one place nineteen can be counted on
islands and mainland when the weather is
clear. The church is always an important and
conspicuous building in every community. A
few colonists, German, French and British,
have located on this island, and have succeeded
in carving a home out of the wilderness if sufficiently
industrious. Nevertheless many of
them have endured great hardships. The
Chilean government brought them over but had
neglected to provide the necessary roads.</p>

<p>Chiloé is the name of a province composed
entirely of islands. In addition to the large
island just described, it includes the archipelagoes
of Chonos and Guaytecas, and embraces
altogether no less than a thousand islands.
Many of them contain only a few inhabitants,
although the natural characteristics are similar
to Chiloé itself. There are several towns
on Chiloé. One of them is Chacao, which, for
two hundred years, was the principal port. It
was founded in 1567, but was practically abandoned
three hundred years later. Castro was
the capital until it was transferred to Ancud
in 1834. These towns were plundered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Dutch freebooters and also destroyed by earthquakes.
Ancud is situated pleasantly, but the
bay seems to be filling up so that large vessels
have to anchor several miles out at sea. Lord
Cochrane once attacked this town and wrested
it from the Spaniards. Living in this town is
very cheap, for the necessities of life can be
purchased in the ample market at very low
prices. South of Ancud there is only one town
of importance, Mellinca, on the Guaytecas archipelago.
With the exception of Punta Arenas
it is the most southerly settlement of any
size in Chile. To-day it is much less important
than formerly, although still somewhat of a
village with probably less than a thousand population.
The first establishment in these towns
is usually a distillery of aguardiente (brandy),
and its product is not a good friend of either
native or settler.</p>

<p>The life both in air and water is very abundant.
The sea is most lavish in life of all kinds,
and can furnish an almost exhaustless supply
of food for those living farther north. The
robalo is a Chilean fish of fine flavour. The
corbina, which is as large as a good-sized cod,
is another good species. The pege-ruge is a
sort of smelt, and the herrings abound in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
countless numbers. Oyster beds too are numerous.
They are all natural beds, however,
but systematic farming might make them as
good as those along our own Atlantic coast.
Other mussels and edible crabs of several
species abound.</p>

<p>With such an abundance of sea life it is
only natural that birds of the fishing tribe
should be plentiful. Huge pelicans, those dirty,
unwieldy birds, are attracted here by this
abounding life. Cormorants are equally numerous,
as they are all along this coast. Penguins
are also found here. The grube, whose
skin is in such demand, is also quite common.
The Antarctic goose is abundant, and the white
gander on guard is a rather beautiful black
and white bird. He always occupies some
prominent rocky point, keeping watch and
guard over his mate intent upon domestic duties.
Insect life is also very busy, and a red
bee almost as large as some humming-birds is
especially characteristic of this region. It flies
rapidly and hovers around among the flowers
almost like the humming-bird.</p>

<p>Opposite Chiloé, on the mainland, is the
Palena River, the largest river in Chile. The
excessive rains and melting snows from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
lofty peaks, which are plainly visible when the
mists have cleared away, keep the banks filled
with water. Every cloud that sweeps in from
the Pacific comes down in rain as soon as it
encounters the mountains. The slopes are
dotted with wood clear up to the snow-line.
The woods here, as well as elsewhere, are seemingly
impenetrable. There are many flowering
trees which add their beauty to the scene. A
tall cane from which the Indians used to make
spears grows in great confusion almost everywhere.
It grows in great stools like giant
bunches of rushes. The genii of vegetation
takes possession of the riches of the ground.
The beautiful green of the Chilean pine predominates.
The mouth of the river is a stretch
of delta. Of course it cannot compare with the
streams on the Atlantic coast, but it is a striking
river. Dancing mountain streams join
it here and there—sometimes with a leap from
the hills, thus forming numerous cascades.
These white streaks of the cascades are visible
on the mountain slopes in many places. The
mists keep shifting and shimmering around
the various peaks,—now revealing and again
hiding the silent glens or gullies. The abundance
of wooding oftentimes almost overcomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the beholder with the helplessness of humanity
in such a region. The north winds which bring
the rains are usually warm, while the south
winds which blow up from the Antarctic regions
are dry and cold. These and the west
winds, which have such a stretch of sea to blow
over, bring the worst storms, for they are not
impeded for thousands of miles.</p>

<p>These facts lead one to speculate on the possibilities
of timber development in Chile. This
republic probably contains almost as great a
proportion of wooded land as any country in
the world. From the Straits to Valdivia it is
almost an unbroken forest. The trees are
sometimes almost covered with parasites. In
places they are almost matted together with
the climbing bamboo, and at others they are
covered with soft cushions of the graceful liverworts
and green mosses. In the extreme
southern part of the republic the trees become
more stunted and gnarled, and are not large
enough to be of commercial value for lumber
purposes. This primeval forest probably extended
along the coast as far as Valparaiso,
since that place was originally selected as a
seaport because the rich woods near at hand
afforded material for shipbuilding. Those forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
have entirely disappeared. In the southern
part of the central valley they are being
ruthlessly destroyed. It is simply cut down
and burned, while the republic as a whole imports
hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth
of timber products from other countries. It is
quite probable that an important lumber industry
is still awaiting development in Southern
Chile. Much of it will certainly be valuable
for wood pulp if for nothing else, so that of
the making of books and periodicals there may
still be no end. The dangerous nature of the
coast may make navigation perilous. The
Pacific Ocean down there is not always so
pacific and peaceful as farther north. The
change is felt soon after leaving Valparaiso
on the journey southward bound.</p>

<p>Chilean Patagonia, which stretches along the
Pacific coast for five hundred miles, is little
known, but it is a region of wild beauty. It
is a perfect labyrinth of channels and islands,
to which there is an entrance at each end, and
one near the centre through the Gulf of Trinidad.
These entrances are through narrow
channels which are difficult to find, as they are
so similar to other channels which lead into
<i>cul-de-sacs</i>. Powerful currents and cross-currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rush through these contracted channels,
so that vessels have to make them at full speed
or run the risk of being dashed helplessly upon
the rocky barriers. Once within the enclosure,
however, the waters are calm even when the
most violent storms rage outside. Terrific
rains which are veritable deluges frequently
fall, and impenetrable mists at times enshroud
everything. The barometer moves up and
down by leaps and bounds. Suddenly a rift
will appear in the clouds, denoting the breaking
of the storm, and the blue sky and bright
sun will be revealed. Then the scenery becomes
glorious in its radiant beauty—an amphitheatre
of overhanging mountains with glittering
snow-dad crests against a sky of dazzling
blue. Then all about will be seen little
islets, covered with trees and bushes of brilliant
green and flowers of many hues.</p>

<p>In spite of the snow-clad mountains the temperature
is usually not extreme. The jungles
will rival the Amazonian jungles. It is a perfect
compress of hollys, ferns, beeches, orchids,
vines and countless thorny bushes. It is indeed</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The surface is a spongy mass, and a foothold
less than knee deep is rare. This exuberant
vegetation is caused by the excessive moisture
which is here precipitated. Flower-bearing
bushes are numerous, and genuine field daisies
are as plentiful in places as on a New England
meadow. Cataracts are everywhere in sight
and mark the mountain sides like long white
streaks. At times when the boat is near the
shore their roar can be heard. An occasional
wreck may be sighted, but more of them lie
unseen, buried beneath countless fathoms of
water, for the shore descends down in an almost
perpendicular line to fathomless depths.
Few vessels thread these narrows, but it is a
sight never to be forgotten by one who has had
the privilege of making the trip.</p>

<p>The future of this great undeveloped region
remains to be seen. At present there are no
inhabitants, except occasionally a stray settlement
of Indians. Exploring itself is no child’s
play, and there are still tracts of untrodden
forest, although the government has had numerous
surveying parties in the field. The
boundary commission has done a great deal in
making this territory better understood. It
differs widely from the broad reaches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pampa of Argentine Patagonia, where rain is
scant and desert stretches are not uncommon.
When development has taken place it may far
exceed in fertility and wealth the eastern
slopes, and the broad leagues of rich plain
between the Andes and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LAND OF THE FIRE</span></h2>

<p>“Tierra del Fuego,” meaning the land of
the fire, exclaimed the followers of Magellan,
as they saw the wreaths of smoke ascending
through the frosty air. It was merely the signal
fires of the Indians dwelling on one of the
islands of that remote southern archipelago,
when they beheld the strange white-winged
vessels of Magellan sailing through the Straits,
since named after him. The name has clung
to the group of islands during the succeeding
centuries, although thousands of white people
have since placed foot on them and the name
is known to be a misnomer, for no volcanic
fires exist there.</p>

<p>Beginning in Alaska, a chain of gigantic
granite vertebrae extends clear to Cape Horn.
It clings close to the Pacific coast throughout
the entire distance, and ends in grandeur near
the Antarctic Circle. Some say that the lower
end of this backbone of the American continents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was shattered by a convulsion, in which
mighty masses of rock were thrown off into
the ocean, thus forming the numberless islands
which lie at the southern extremity of South
America. The better theory, however, is that
they were formed by the submerging of the
lower end of the Andes Mountains. When the
land sank the stormy water beat through the
valleys and chiselled the shores into incongruous
shapes and labyrinths.</p>

<p>Between the islands and the mainland are
the Straits of Magellan. Some of the finest
scenery in the world is found in this intricate
waterway, especially in what is known as
Smyth’s Channel, which separates Southern
Chile from the group of islands. Smyth’s Channel
is very narrow, so that most vessels take
the broader Straits. The depth has never been
fathomed. There is a grandeur in the serrated
peaks, and cliffs, snowy crests, cascades and
the glaciers under a brilliant sun and deep
blue sky that is simply overwhelming. Numerous
mountain peaks reveal themselves, of
which Mt. Sarmiento is the noblest, and lifts
its snowy head to a height of over seven
thousand feet. Its beauty is enhanced by numerous
blue-tinted glaciers, which descend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the waters of the sea like a multitude of frozen
Niagaras. Floating glaciers are common in
the Straits, and vessels, unequipped with ice-making
machinery, often tie up to one while
the crew chop enough ice to fill the refrigerators.</p>

<p>Few places on the earth’s surface within
easy reach can compare with the Straits of
Magellan. This channel has become the great
trade route between the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. Few boats, except sailing vessels, now
take the longer route around Cape Horn, because
of the storms that lash the Antarctic seas
into fury. For several hundred miles the
Straits furnish a succession of beautiful
scenes; green shores alternating with the eternal
glaciers of the mountain peaks, blue waters
contrasting with the shimmering crystal of the
floating icebergs. These masses of ice are as
imperishable as the glaciers of Greenland, and
they add a feature to the scenery that is not
to be found elsewhere within the ordinary
course of steamers. It is a region of marvellous
sunsets as well as rugged scenery, when
the weather is clear, but mist, snow or rain
often dim the view.</p>

<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">IN THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN.</p>
</div>

<p>The eastern entrance to the Straits lies between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Cape Virgenes, on the mainland, and
Cape Espiritu, on the island, a distance of
about fourteen miles. For some distance the
channel is wide, with the mainland gently undulating
and covered with grass. Then come
the first narrows, and afterwards the second
narrows. These narrows are about two miles
in width, and there is generally a strong current
through them. In the spring the tides are
thrown up to a height of fifty feet, and this is
the reason sailing vessels prefer the open
waters around Cape Horn, even though the
seas are more tempestuous. When nearing
Punta Arenas the mountains become higher,
and at times the way seems blocked by them.
Stunted bush and underbrush appear. After
leaving Punta Arenas the shores grow bolder
and more picturesque. The snow-covered
mountains and glaciers resemble the Alaska
coast or that of Northern Norway. The islands
are as numerous as in the St. Lawrence
or Georgian Bay.</p>

<p>Nodales Peak and Mt. Victoria lift their
hoary heads on the mainland, while Mt. Buckland
and Mt. Sarmiento rise to a still greater
height on the islands. The latter beautiful and
majestic peak is the noblest of them all. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
snowy head rises to a height of seven thousand
three hundred feet, with a broad base and two
distinct peaks. It is generally more or less
hidden by vapour. The three Evangelistas
keep their lonely vigil where straits and ocean
join on the north. Cape Pillar, the western
end of the Straits, is two hundred and forty-five
miles from Cape Virgenes, but the steamer
route is almost half as long again. Old voyagers
were wont to take eighty days in this
passage when the weather was a little unfavourable.
The western end is the stormiest,
and the pilot books give it a very bad reputation.
South of them the Antarctic seas are
seldom free from the storm king. The weather
is nearly always bad, and oftentimes worse.
In one recent year it is said that eighty-two
sailing vessels and thirty-nine steamers were
lost—a fearful toll claimed by old Neptune.</p>

<p>Fernando de Magelhaens, although of Portuguese
birth, had entered the Spanish service.
In charge of a fleet of five small ships, the
largest of only one hundred and thirty tons,
boarded and manned by a crew of sixty-two
men, he sailed from Seville on the 10th of
August, 1519. The voyage was an arduous one,
and was beset not only with terrific storms at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sea but mutinies among the sailors that were
scarcely less terrifying. Only two of his vessels
remained faithful, but he conquered the
mutiny with the loss of only one vessel. On
the 21st of October, 1520, he entered the eastern
entrance of the channel, and it was a month
later, after almost unheard-of difficulties, that
he emerged into the broad Pacific. Of the subsequent
expeditions that attempted this route
the experiences were most unfortunate. In
nearly every instance almost one out of every
three vessels was wrecked, some in one channel
and some in another, for there is a perfect labyrinth
of channels around and between the
many islands. Some of the names indicate the
experiences or impressions of these early navigators.
Fatal Bay, Port Famine, Famine
Reach, Escape Beach, Last Wreck Point, Dislocation
Harbour, Thieves Island, Useless Bay,
Fury Islands, Breakneck Peninsula, Desolation
Harbour, Preservation Cove, and last, Hope
Inlet, are a few of the names that may be located
on the map. In 1578, Sir Francis Drake,
an English explorer as well as freebooter, by
accident found the route by the way of Cape
Horn. This great discovery stimulated navigation
around South America, for the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
guarded the Straits route to the best of
their ability. The Spaniards described Drake
as “a man of low condition, but a skilful seaman
and a valiant pirate.”</p>

<p>The Fuegian Archipelago covers a goodly
territory. The islands contain as much land
as Nebraska, and are several hundred miles
long from east to west. A perfect labyrinth of
tortuous, wind-swept waterways separate the
hundreds of islands which form this group.
They are not all a desolate mass of ice and
snow, however, but contain plains which are
covered with succulent grasses, and slopes
which are thickly wooded. The Chilean portion
of these islands, and the mainland along
the coast beyond the fiftieth parallel of latitude,
is included in the territory of Magellanes,
the largest territorial division in the
republic. The largest island, called Tierra del
Fuego, land of the fire, is half as large as Illinois.
It is divided longitudinally between
Chile and Argentina, by far the largest portion
belonging to the former nation, and the best
part of it too.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago this entire island was
roamed and hunted over by the aborigines.
The fact that the northern part consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
open country, with few ranges of hills, caused
the white man to look upon it with envious
eyes, as it promised good pasturage for sheep.
Then began a warfare against the Indians
which almost resulted in their extermination.
Thousands of sheep now quietly graze in the
rich valleys and on the verdant plains, and
thrive very well indeed. Very little of the land
is cultivated, although probably susceptible of
cultivation, but the marketing of the products
would be a difficult feature at the present time,
and the season is short. Its latitude is about
that of Southern Greenland, but the climate is
probably milder, and its longitude is approximately
that of Eastern Massachusetts. In the
summer the grass is green, but in the winter
the chilly winds change it to a rich brown. The
ground rats are a terrible nuisance to the
farmer, as they burrow in the fields so much
that they destroy half the usefulness of a good
meadow. The mountain slopes are covered
with a thick growth of trees, ferns and mosses
up to a height of a thousand feet or more, due
to the great amount of rainfall, but above that
distance the growth is very stunted. It seems
strange to see green trees and green grasses
amid snows and glaciers, but such is the contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
offered by this “land of the fire.” The
trees are mostly evergreen, not very high, but
very close together. A deep bed of moss, into
which a man may sink knee-deep, generally
surrounds them, and large ferns with leaves
a yard long grow in places otherwise bare.
Even bright flowers make the sombre landscape
seem almost gay when the sun shines on
a summer day.</p>

<p>Desolation Island, on the Chilean side, is a
bleak and barren island well indicated by its
name, while other names are Clarence, St. Inas,
and Navarin. There are many others, from
islands twenty miles in length to some so small
that a good baseball pitcher could toss a stone
clear over them. Cape Horn is a monster rock
which thrusts its jagged outline into the Antarctic
seas. It is a couple of hundred miles
south of the Straits of Magellan, and more
than a thousand miles nearer the undiscovered
South Pole than the Cape of Good Hope. It
is surrounded by waters that are tossed by
terrific storms which mariners fear. The hulks
of wrecked vessels can be seen on every hand
as reminders of the terrible tribute which has
been here levied. Glaciers are always in sight,
and masses of ice hundreds of feet high are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
frequently seen, seeming to threaten the venturesome
mariner for invading those beautiful
waters.</p>

<p class="caption">A WRECK ON THE COAST OF CHILE.</p>
</div>

<p>A number of years ago a steamer was
wrecked on these shores, but the crew managed
to save sufficient provisions to sustain all those
rescued for some time. While sinking shallow
wells they discovered a strata of black sand
that sparkled with particles of gold. Their
reports led to great excitement over the discovery
of gold on Tierra del Fuego. Although
adventurers had sailed through the Straits for
centuries, looking for the wealth that they
might obtain either honestly or dishonestly, yet
the gold deposits remained undiscovered until
1867. Their covetous eyes had gazed upon the
gold-bearing shores, and they had even filled
their water-casks in the gold-bearing rivulets
without seeing the wealth. In the few years
following a number of Argentine explorers visited
that region, and found the source of some
of the gold. The gold was almost exclusively
found in free particles in a layer of black sand,
which was found under the surface sand. As
soon as the report of their find reached the
settlements, a number of expeditions were fitted
out and sent to that region. The best payings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were found right on the beach, which was
washed by the waves of the sea at a high tide
and during storms. It was also found that the
tides brought in fresh gold-bearing sands from
the seas. The miners used to sit down and
smoke their pipes until the storms passed, and
then dig up the black sand with the gold in it
after the surf had gone down.</p>

<p>It all seemed to be pockets, so that where the
gold would be found in considerable quantities
for a while, it would soon become so scarce that
mining it under the crude conditions prevailing
became unprofitable. The prospectors
sailed in and out of the stormy and dangerous
bays, and many of them lost their lives. The
hidden reefs and whirling tornadoes form combinations
that made navigation in the small
catboats that were used extremely perilous.
Many, who were wrecked, were obliged to live
upon whatever wild food they could find for
weeks, and others were killed by the hostile
Indians. The original stories said that nuggets
as big as kernels of corn were plentiful,
but they were not true to fact. No gold quartz
veins were ever discovered, but in all the finds
it was simply particles mixed up with the black
sand. Gold mining to-day is not prosecuted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that region as much as it was a couple of decades
ago, although some gold is washed each
year. If the whole story was known, it would
probably be found that there were more skeletons
of dead miners left on those inhospitable
shores than records of wealth acquired in Tierra
del Fuego. Most of those who did find
wealth got no farther than Punta Arenas with
it, for that city was to that region what San
Francisco was in the early days of California,
and mining prospectors are the same the world
over.</p>

<p>The first attempt to establish a settlement
on the Straits of Magellan was in the latter
part of the sixteenth century. Pedro Sarmiento
de Gamboa was placed in command of
this expedition. His instructions were as follows:
“For the honour and glory of God and
of the Virgin Mary, His Mother and Our Lady,
whom you, Captain Pedro Sarmiento, are to
take for Advocate and Patron of the ships and
crews under your orders for this discovery and
enterprise in the Straits of Magellan.” After
several narrow escapes from shipwreck the expedition
landed, and established a settlement
not far from the present city of Punta Arenas.
From the very first misfortune seemed to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the colonists, and the Indians soon became
hostile. At the end of the second winter the
three hundred or more colonists had dwindled
to eighteen, who were finally rescued. They had
been obliged to live on berries, shell-fish, oysters,
and such other ocean life that they were
able to catch. The Indians had driven the
guanaco and other wild game into the interior
where the colonists could not reach them.</p>

<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW OF PUNTA ARENAS.</p>
</div>

<p>The continent of South America extends
much farther south than Africa. The southernmost
point is Cape Frowards, which is a
dark mass of rock five hundred feet high joined
by a low neck of land to snow-clad mountains.
At almost the southernmost point of the mainland
lies the little city of Punta Arenas (Sandy
Point). It is situated on the Straits of Magellan,
which is sheltered from the worst
storms by the many islands that lie between
it and the Antarctic seas. Punta Arenas is the
southernmost city in the world, eight hundred
miles farther south than Cape Town. There
is plenty of building space left in this city still,
but a few years ago, when the boom was on,
the people had visions of a southern Chicago.
Fabulous prices were asked for building lots,
and real estate agents were almost as plentiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
as the Indians. That time has passed, and the
town has dwindled in population. Its latitude
is about that of Labrador, but it is much more
equable than that country and the weather is
not so severe as many imagine. It is so named
because built on a sandy beach that runs out
into the Straits. It is now a city of twelve
thousand people, and they seem to be contented.
It is a very mixed population. You
can hear Spanish, English, German, Italian,
Russian and even the Chinese mingled with
the guttural tongues of the Indians. The
Scotch are probably the most thrifty of the
inhabitants, and many of them have lived there
two or three generations.</p>

<p>There are many rough characters in Punta
Arenas, some even who have drifted from the
mining camps of our western states. It is said
to be bad policy to ask a man where he came
from, or what his name was before his arrival,
as it might be an embarrassing subject. The
loafing places are the bars, where many brawls
occur during the long winters. There are
probably as many saloons to the number of
inhabitants as in any other place on the globe,
for nearly every other door seems to bear such
a sign. Much gambling is also done at these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and in the clubs. There are clubs, where
the well-to-do gather and have their games just
as they do the world over. The principal club
is the Cuerpo de Bomberos, which means the
Society of Firemen, and was organized as a
volunteer fire department. Most of the buildings
are cheap one-story affairs, frequently
being built of the corrugated iron so common
in this land. Punta Arenas is a free port, and
this fact has aided in its prosperity. All the
vessels passing through the Straits call there
for supplies and coal, and this business, together
with the trade in whaling products, wool
and furs, furnish the inhabitants with employment.
It is one of the great wool-exporting
ports of the world, having shipped more than
sixteen million pounds of that commodity in a
single season, and four hundred thousand pelts.
The trade in furs is very large. One of the
prettiest things sold here is an ostrich robe
made of the breasts of the young birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus26">

<p class="caption">PORT FAMINE, IN THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Punta Arenas is the business centre of the
region extending from Port Desire, on the
Patagonian coast to Cape Horn, and from the
Falkland Islands on the east to the westernmost
limits of Chile. The little settlement that
originally was established there was called La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Colonia de Magellanes. On the 21st of April,
1843, Chile first planted her tri-coloured banner
at a place near here, which was called Port
Famine, because of the disastrous end of the
Sarmiento settlement, which had been located
there a couple of centuries previously.</p>

<p>Chile had a double purpose in establishing
this post. One was its desire to hold the territory
as a national possession, and the other
was to establish a penal colony which would
be so far away from the capital that the prisoners,
even if they escaped, could not return.
Several hundred prisoners were generally confined
there, who were kept in subjection by a
small company of soldiers. On two occasions
the convicts rebelled and took possession of
this settlement. On one of these the governor
and many of the guards were killed and the
mutineers boarded a ship that chanced to be
in the harbour, but they were overtaken by a
Chilean man-of-war and overcome. The men
were hung, and it is said that a man was seen
hanging from every yard-arm of the war-ship.
After the first revolt a new settlement was
established on the present site of Punta Arenas,
which was given the old name. The tongue
of sand there, however, the English-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
people called Sandy Point, and thereafter the
name Punta Arenas, which means the same in
Spanish, was given it; at least it is entirely
known by that name now.</p>

<p>In 1877 the last revolt occurred, when the
convicts revenged the cruelties to which they
had been subjected upon the commander of the
garrison and many of the soldiers. When a
man-of-war appeared they fled into the interior,
where most of them died from starvation
and hardships. The establishment of the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company was the cause
of the abandonment of this place as a penal
colony. It proved to be a convenient stopping
place for the steamers to take on coal and supplies,
and this gave it a new life. Later came
the discovery of gold, which brought many
to the settlement. Still later a Scotchman
brought some sheep from the Falkland Islands,
and found that the region around Punta Arenas
and on the island opposite was well adapted
for sheep raising. Others took advantage
of this experience, until the neighbourhood
around became noted for its sheep culture.
Some day, if a freezing establishment should
be established here, Punta Arenas will become
a still more important place, and it is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
only a question of time until such will be
done. The town itself makes a poor foreground
for the magnificent setting of nature.
It is laid out on the usual checkerboard plan,
with several streets running from the shores
back up the hills. It has a plaza and the streets
are unpaved. The beach is sandy and the
streets are either filled with loose sand or mud.</p>

<p>Across the Straits the green hills of Tierra
del Fuego may be seen rising, and over to the
south the snow-capped peaks of Mt. Sarmiento
and its neighbours appear above the horizon.
To the west are mountains which are ever
green and rise boldly up to the western edge,
while to the north the hills are generally bare.
At one time it was thought that coal had been
discovered and the mine was opened up; some
track was built and an old locomotive brought
down. It proved, however, to be only lignite,
and so the mine has been practically abandoned.</p>

<p>A considerable trade has been developed in
Indian curios and goods. The Indians from
the pampas and islands come here to sell their
furs, feathers, bows, hides, etc. Passengers
passing through the Straits on the various
steamers usually lay in a supply of these goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
some of which are genuine and others are prepared
especially for such passengers. One
wonders at the number of palms and plants
which are seen in this town so far beyond all
other settlements, for even wild flowers of certain
kinds seem to grow in great profusion,
while ferns and lichens everywhere delight the
eye.</p>

<p>South of Punta Arenas there is only one settlement
of any importance, and that is Ushuaia.
This town is situated on the Argentine
side of Tierra del Fuego, and, small as it is,
it is the capital of that territory. It stands
nearer to the South Pole than any other civilized
village in the world. The barriers created
by nature are almost insurmountable. To
the south is the unknown Antarctic, to the
north the impassable barrier of snow-clad
peaks, and in all other directions are the fathomless
channels separating it from the other
islands. Established first as a mission settlement,
its site was selected as the capital of the
territory. The Argentine flag was first unfolded
over the first building erected for the
use of officials in 1884. Shortly after that work
upon prisons was begun, and it became a still
more important settlement. Here, in this isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
quarter of the globe, guarded by a few
score of armed men, are confined several hundred
men, many of whom are the very dregs of
humanity sent from Buenos Aires. These unfortunates
work on the roads, dress stone for
new and stronger walls, or make the garments
worn by themselves and their fellow prisoners.
Few attempt to escape and fewer still succeed,
for the loneliness and desolation alone would
keep a prisoner where human companionship
may be found.</p>

<p>Small and unimportant as this town is to-day,
and wretched as it would seem to many
people, yet it has a full complement of officials
with their secretaries and servants. There is
a complete list of judicial officers and police
officials, even though the police have no patrol
to beat and the court has no docket. About
the only part of the official equipment that has
any work to do is the culinary department, for
it takes a great deal of cooking and preparation
to provide food for every one there. Out
of a population of several hundred to-day,
made up principally of prisoners and officials,
there are only a very few plain common citizens
who dwell there.</p>

<p>Most of the buildings in Ushuaia are frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
structures, which have been erected near the
bay that bears the same name as the town. It
is situated on Beagle Channel. The houses
consist of plain unpainted wooden walls, with
a roof of corrugated iron. The governor’s
palace itself is not much better than the other
buildings. A few of the buildings have little
green patches, enclosed with picket fences, in
which they are able to grow a few vegetables.
For a location so far south the climate is not
so bad as one would expect, as the snowfall is
not as great as in the same latitude in northern
regions. In the winter time the nights are
very long and the days short. The mountains
just at the back of the town cut off the sunlight
when the sun is low, so that the town only receives
about four hours of daylight. It is certainly
a cheerless sort of existence that the
people lead in this southern capital. There are
still one or two missions that are conducted by
English missionaries on this coastland, but
they have had very little influence upon the
natives. One of the missions consists of quite
a large ranch, where the minister in charge of
the mission lives and employs the natives to do
his work.</p>

<p>For several hundred miles north of Punta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Arenas lies the formerly unknown land of Patagonia—the
land of the Pata-goas, the “big
feet,” as they were named by Magellan. One
can see in that city almost any day descendants
of that race in the Tehuelche tribe of Indians
who come there to sell their furs and skins.
Out upon the broad pampas away from the
town, the traveller will occasionally stumble
upon the <i>toldos</i> (huts) of the Tehuelches.
These are simply made huts of the skins of
the guanaco sewn loosely together at the edges,
and supported squarely upon awkward-looking
props, or posts, forked at the top to admit the
ridge-poles. The skins are fastened to the
earth by wooden pegs. The Tehuelches are the
native Indians of Patagonia—the so-called
giants—and are well built specimens of manhood.
These Indians live almost as their ancestors
did hundreds of years ago. They are
still nomads, and exist entirely by the chase.
They do not cultivate anything whatever, but
sometimes own a few cattle. In general they
still dress in skins, although some of them have
purchased store clothes at the settlements. As
a rule they are mild mannered, when sober,
and do not deserve the name of being bloodthirsty
savages. Their numbers have greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
decreased, since the first discovery of Patagonia,
through dissipation and disease, and
some have estimated that the total number yet
remaining will not exceed a few hundred.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago the geographers labelled
Patagonia “no man’s land.” To-day
millions of sheep graze over its fertile plains.
It is as large as several of our western states.
It is a land of big distances and enormous holdings.
In the pasture section it is often a ride
of three or four days from one ranch to another.
Most of these ranches are near the
coast or along the few rivers. As one travels
into the interior a white face becomes more
and more rare; empty leagues surround you
on every hand. One accustomed to cities only
would find it very lonely indeed on these plains.
One seems to stand alone with only the wind,
the mirages and the limitless distances, and
the blue sky above for a canopy. The last land
to have been the habitation of the greater
beasts of preceding ages, according to geologists,
Patagonia is one of the last to receive its
proper share of the human population.</p>

<p>There are three races of Indians who inhabit
these Fuegian islands, the Yahgans, Alacaloofs
and the Onas, all of whom are very low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in intelligence. They are commonly known
under the general characterization of the Firelanders.
None of them are as far advanced
as the Esquimaux, who build warm igloos for
their habitation. Even though the climate is
very cold the greater part of the year these
aborigines formerly wore very little clothing,
but greased their bodies with fish oil that keeps
out the cold. In recent years, however, they
have begun to wear warmer garments, when
such can be obtained. The Yahgans are very
treacherous, and many murders have been
traced to them. They will mingle very little
with white people, but always hold themselves
aloof. Their houses are of the most primitive
character, and are frequently little more than
a rude construction of thatch on a skeleton of
sticks stuck in the ground.</p>

<p>These Yahgans live almost entirely on sea
food. They divide their time between these
rude huts and canoes, or dugouts made from
the trunks of trees, in which they paddle
through the tortuous channels from one island
to another. Should a storm overtake the boat
and it becomes necessary to lighten it, the men
show their instinct for self-preservation by
throwing the women and children overboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
They are not particular about food, as to
whether it is very fresh or not. There is frequently
a dearth of food, and then it is that they
are driven to eat the flesh of a stranded whale
or of an animal found dead. Ground rats and
the fishy-flavoured penguin are included on
their regular bill-of-fare. Their camping-places
can generally be located by the mounds
of shells that accumulate. They are as near
to primitive savages as it would be possible
to find on the Americas. As usual among savage
tribes, the women do the most of the work,
and assist in the hunting and fishing as well
as prepare the meat after it has once been
caught. The Yahgans are short and muscular
and below medium height. Their lower limbs
seem rather stunted, but above the waist they
are heavily built. Marriage is a matter of
purchase and sale, and wives are sometimes
exchanged. The marriage ceremony consists
in painting the girl in a peculiar way, and then
the husband takes her to his hut or that of his
parents.</p>

<p>The Alacaloofs, or Alakalufs, occupy the
western islands and are similar in their habits
to the Yahgans. Their canoes are made of
strips of bark or planks fastened together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
vines and caulked with moss. Their huts look
like New England haycocks made of boughs
and covered with skins or bark strips. They
frequently row out to meet passing steamers
and beg for food. They are not an attractive
people. In colour they strongly resemble the
North American red men, but they are not
much over five feet in height. The only domesticated
animal owned by them is the dog.
With this tribe, as well as the Yahgans, everything
is held in common and it is no crime to
take of your neighbour’s fuel or food.</p>

<p>The Onas are a hunting tribe and they are
larger than either of the other tribes. They
occupy the prairie lands and open bush of
Tierra del Fuego. The men are active and
athletic, and they are especially skilful in
stalking the guanaco of that island. They are
expert in the use of the rude bows and arrows
which they make for themselves. The bows
are fashioned out of a native wood cut with
shell knives, and the arrows are made out of
reeds armed with a flint or glass point. Horse
meat is a great delicacy with them. The struggle
for existence has made these people inexpressive
in features and stoical in actions. A
good fortune or an ill fortune is met in much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the same way. Their homes are generally
saucer-shaped hollows that have been scraped
out, over which poles and brush are piled and
guanaco skins are used as doors. All the family
lie down together, and the dogs are included
for warmth. They are nomads and wander
from one place to another in search of food.
Fire is made with bits of iron ore or flints and
dry fungus. Some of this tribe are now employed
as servants by the white people, but
most of them prefer the wild life in the open.</p>

<p>With all the hardships that seem to fall to
the lot of these Indians who live so far to the
south, they seem to be fairly happy and are
contented with their surroundings. This is
truly fortunate. People who live in the temperate
zones are inclined to think that they are
the only truly happy ones. By travel one’s
view is broadened, and at last he realizes the
truth expressed by Oliver Goldsmith in the
following lines:—</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BACKBONE OF THE CONTINENT</span></h2>

<p>The trip across the continent of South
America is now made very comfortably by
train. The start is from the very pleasant station
of the State Railway of Valparaiso. For
a number of miles the tracks run almost along
the water’s edge, and thus afford many beautiful
views of the blue bay of Valparaiso. The
trains on this road are very comfortable, for
the Chilean State Railway is one of the very
few railroads in South America that provide
Pullman cars for their patrons. After leaving
Viña del Mar the line soon abandons the bay,
and threads its way through the coast range
of mountains. One gets many glimpses of the
higher Andes through the passes, and there
are also green glens where advantage has been
taken of the running water for irrigation.
Cacti become very abundant, and one is reminded
of the plateaus of Mexico, for these
silent sentinels seem to keep watch over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
herds of sheep and goats that feed on the
slopes. Any one who has seen Southern Chile
first will notice the difference as soon as the
train leaves Santiago. The progressive dryness
of the climate has a pronounced effect on
the vegetation. The cacti are frequently from
twelve to fifteen feet in height, and their entire
surface is covered with stout, curved spines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus27">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ACONCAGUA RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>After creeping along the shore and then
through a valley, the railroad soon joins the
Aconcagua River, which leaps and foams along,
thus forming a series of diminutive cascades.
In the winter time the change in temperature
is very marked as the upward climb continues.
In places the valley spreads out to quite generous
proportions, and one will see <i>haciendas</i>
that are well kept up and which show evidence
of careful cultivation. Contrast is afforded by
the sight of oxen drawing one-handled, wooden
ploughs. How powerful must have been the
Moorish influence in Spain, for these ploughs
are exact duplicates of the plough of ancient
Chaldea and Egypt, which was carried along
the coast of Barbary into Spain, and left there
as a heritage to the Spaniards, who introduced
it into the New World. The general impression
left with the traveller over this route, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Valparaiso and Santiago, is one of comparative
barrenness and desolation.</p>

<p>Viña del Mar, Limache and Quillota are
three quite important towns that are passed
<i>en route</i>, the latter two of which have some important
manufacturing establishments. Llai
Llai (pronounced Yi-yi) is about half way,
and this is the diverging point for the two
routes. One leads to the capital, and the other
is the continuation of the transcontinental railroad.
Llai Llai is a pleasant little town of
five or six thousand inhabitants, and is situated
about twenty-six hundred and twenty-five feet
above sea level. A number of fruit sellers are
sure to be at the station, and one who does
not purchase a few of the delicious pears or
peaches, that are sold so reasonably, misses a
great treat. They are grown in a rich valley
below which is a sort of agricultural Arcadia.</p>

<p>The through cars are switched to another
track, a different engine is attached to them
and the traveller is soon bound for Los Andes.
The journey does not differ greatly from that
already described. The city of San Felipe is
the largest town passed and it is situated
amidst well cultivated fields. It is a city of
about twelve thousand. Soon afterwards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
train reaches Santa Rosa de Los Andes, which
marks a break in the journey. Here it is necessary
to change trains, and frequently to stay
over night. It is at the foothills of the Andes,
and one can find many pleasant little excursions
into the foothills here, if he has the inclination
to tarry for a few days. The climate
is good, and the physical wants of the traveller
are very well looked after at the hotel. A few
Americans will be found there, for the railroad
is operated by that nationality.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus28">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LOOKING TOWARDS ACONCAGUA.</p>
</div>

<p>If it is the summer time one will find Los
Andes a very pleasant little place, with quite
an abundance of vegetation around it. The
altitude is about twenty-six hundred feet,
which gives it a delightful climate. Fruits
grow abundantly, and the fruit-canning industry
has been considerably developed. This is
in the province of Aconcagua, which contains
some of the most notable elevations in the
entire republic, and, in fact, in the entire world.
This province is about as large as Connecticut
and Rhode Island combined. In addition to
the eastern boundary of lofty peaks there are
numerous low hills, between which lie fertile
valleys. Through the use of irrigation agriculture
flourishes in these valleys, and there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
considerable production of grains and wine.
There are also a number of silver and copper
mines in the province. San Felipe is the capital,
and is distant about seventy-eight miles
from both Santiago and Valparaiso.</p>

<p>“<i>Vamonos</i>,” says the conductor of the narrow
gauge train, as it pulls out of the station
on its way to the limits of Chilean territory.
One will begin to take notice of his fellow-travellers.
The passengers will be found to
be of many nationalities, and of many shades
of colour, for, since the railway journey is continuous,
fewer people take the much longer
route via the Straits of Magellan. There will
be Chilenos, with big hats and <i>ponchos</i>, and
Chilenas, whose faces are coated with powder
or paste. There will be priests in beaver hats
and black gowns, which reach to their feet.
Soldiers in uniforms modelled after the German
army are quite likely to be companions as
far as the border. Americans, British, French,
Germans, Italians and Argentinians—all of
these nationalities go to make up a potpourri
of nations and national characteristics. As the
start is generally made in the morning, one
sees the stars disappear and the dawn break
over the mountains. The gray skies turn to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
steel-blue, then to a rosy pink, until, at last,
the highest peaks are illuminated by the rays
of the sun. One may leave Los Andes clad in
its summer plumage, with myriads of butterflies
and moths flitting about, but these characteristics
soon disappear, for the upward
climb begins almost immediately. In the next
thirty-five miles this rack and pinion road
climbs upward more than seven thousand feet.
It is a much steeper ascent than on the Argentine
side, for it requires three times the distance
to reach the same level on that slope.</p>

<p>The track follows the course of the Aconcagua
River. This river is at no time a great
stream, yet the total volume of water carried
down in its swift-flowing current must be considerable.
Many glimpses of the simple natives,
and their primitive means of conveyance,
are afforded on the ancient highway that
threads the same valley. On the mountainside
an occasional mud hut may be seen around and
over which climb creepers and flowering vines.
The scenery is beautiful and full of variations.
Every turn of the tortuous track reveals a new
scene of beauty, and there are few railway
journeys in the world that will afford a greater
variety of views than this overland route to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Buenos Aires. The mountains grow from
grand to grander, as if Ossa had been piled
upon Pelion. When sunlight and shadow play
upon the rock the contrasts are dazzling and
the senses gladdened. There is a prodigality
of colours such as even the Yosemite, the
Grand Cañon or the Dolomites do not surpass.
Guardia Viega, the “old guard,” is one of the
stations, and is so named because it was for
two centuries a guard station on the Antiguo
Camino, or ancient road between the two republics.
The vegetation becomes scanter as
the altitude increases, but, scant as it is, it is
a pleasing change to the traveller coming from
the other direction. Juncal, which for several
years was the terminus, is passed. One of the
most beautiful views afforded is that of the
narrow gorge, known as the Salto del Soldado,
the Soldier’s Leap, through which the tempestuous
waters of the river foam and toss.
There is a tradition connected with this strange
freak of nature of which the Chileans are
proud. During the war of independence it is
said that a Chilean pursued by the enemy,
leaped across this chasm and saved his life.
Owing to the width it is an almost impossible
tale to believe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus29">
<img src="images/illus29.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SALTO DEL SOLDADO.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Just beyond Juncal is a beautiful little lake,
which is as opalescent and translucent as any
of the lakes of Switzerland, and several thousand
feet higher. It is the Lago del Inca, the
Lake of the Incas. Pure as crystal, and clear
as an unclouded sky, this little body of water
rests tranquilly amidst as harsh and severe a
setting as one could well find. Masses of rock
seem poised on ledges ready to project themselves
down into valleys with destruction in
their path. The mad gods who formed these
eternal peaks must have paused for a moment
in their work in order to add this one touch of
real beauty to the landscape.</p>

<p>Here one may also see the huge condors,
flying at such heights that they look no larger
than a swallow. The glass will sometimes reveal
others that can scarcely be distinguished
with the naked eye. They sail and circle
around in the rarefied air with scarcely a flap
of the wing. In the winter time the condor
may be found near the coast, but in summer
they always return to the highest Andean
peaks, where they rear their young. The eggs
are deposited in lofty clefts or caverns, where
no form of animal life exists that might destroy
the young birds. A young condor during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the first year clings to the parent bird, for its
body is too big for its wings. This royal bird
figures on the national escutcheon of Chile as
an emblem of strength and independence. The
Indians surround it with many legends, and
some of them believe that the souls of the lost
enter the bodies of the condor and are thus
poised between heaven and earth, so as to see
the glories of both and be able to enjoy neither,
like the doom of Tantalus.</p>

<p>At last Caracoles, the name given to the little
station at the Chilean end of the international
railroad, is reached, at an elevation of
a little more than ten thousand feet above sea
level. The tunnel is just about the same length
as the altitude, for it is ten thousand three hundred
and eighty-five feet from entrance to exit.
Near the centre of this hole bored through the
Andean rock the international boundary is
passed, and, when the train emerges at Las
Cuevas, the other terminus, the traveller
catches his first glimpse of Argentina. It is
a scene of vast desolation that meets his gaze.
It is a picture of solitude, with nothing to relieve
it in the way of vegetation. The vivid
colourings of the stratas of rock and the white
summits of the many peaks in sight, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
make it a scene of wild glory that uplifts the
soul at the majesty of nature. One stands
aghast at the marvellous richness of colouring
that is revealed on every hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus30">
<img src="images/illus30.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">REFUGE HOUSE ALONG THE OLD INCA TRAIL.</p>
</div>

<p>The traveller may be thankful that he has
not been obliged to traverse this pass in the
winter time. Nothing can surpass these vast
ridges clad in their winter dress. White and
cold, they form a veritable valley of desolation.
It is the cold of death, the white mantle of
annihilation—something that the brain can
scarcely compass. The feeling of solitude in
the midst of the whiteness everywhere almost
overwhelms the traveller with despair. In
places the snow is frequently as much as fifteen
feet in depth, deep enough to bury a horse
and rider. Sudden storms are likely to overtake
the traveller, and he would be snowed in
in one of the <i>casuchas</i>. These are shelters that
were built at intervals along the pass for the
protection of travellers. They are dome-shaped
structures which remind one of lime-kilns.
They have a small door, but no windows,
and will accommodate as many as twenty
people at a time. The interior has a brick floor
and is absolutely bare. Although protected
from the weather, woe be to the traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
obliged to spend a day or two there with a
group of <i>arrieros</i>, for filth is everywhere and
the stench is almost overpowering.</p>

<p>Although fewer travellers ventured over this
pass in the midst of winter, the mail service
continued uninterruptedly, and there was seldom
a day that some one did not attempt the
crossing. A <i>capitas</i>, who was generally a man
with a little capital, would undertake to carry
the mails or other freight over the pass at a
fixed price. He would then engage his force
of porters as cheaply as possible, agreeing to
furnish them with board and lodging so long
as they remained with him. As time was not
specified in the mail contract, if a traveller
came along the <i>capitas</i> would dump the mails
and carry his baggage at an exorbitant price.
Everything was done up in packages weighing
about sixty pounds. Some of the porters
would even undertake to carry two of these—a
terrible strain on a rough road. It is little
wonder that this and unrestrained dissipation
usually gave these men a short life. Sometimes
they slid over a precipice, or were hurled to
their doom by a falling stone. There are many
graves of those who met an untimely end along
this route, and it seems almost marvellous that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
they are not more numerous. After the highest
point was passed the porters would toboggan
down the slopes, seated on a sheepskin and
guiding themselves with pointed staffs. In
this way the descent was quickly accomplished.
The packages were simply tumbled down, and
oftentimes reached the bottom in a very dilapidated
condition.</p>

<p>The Trasandino Argentino Railway threads
its way out through the valley of the Uspallata,
and follows a small stream which gradually
becomes larger as little rivulets of melted snow
join it. It soon becomes more of a stream, and
is given the name of Rio (river) Mendoza. At
a distance of less than a dozen miles the station
called Puente del Inca is reached, which is so
named because of a natural bridge of stratified
rock at that place, which is very similar to the
Natural Bridge of Virginia. Underneath it
bubble up boiling waters which are claimed to
have great medicinal value. It is said that the
Incas in pre-Spanish times knew of the value
of these waters, and their chiefs came here to
receive the benefits of its curative waters.
Near here one catches a glimpse of a marvellous
freak of nature, called the Cerro de los
Penitentes, the Ridge of the Penitents. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
scattered rocky peaks and points standing up
through the sloping debris of the ascent, with
their remarkable imitations of toiling wayfarers,
must have greatly impressed the Spanish
pioneers when they first came upon this
scene.</p>

<p>The route continues a picture of desolation,
caused by volcanic upheavals and the erosion
of countless ages. The Mendoza River, coloured
by the various metals of the rocks over
which it pours, tumbles along near the railway
as both follow one pass after another. Las
Vacas, Uspallata, La Invernada and other
small stations are passed. About thirty miles
before Mendoza is reached a change begins,
and poplar and larch trees, alfalfa fields and
the grape enliven the scene. Irrigation is utilized
and the melted snows cause the land to
bloom with remarkable fertility. At last the
train runs into the creditable station of Mendoza,
and the second stage in the transcontinental
journey is ended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;" id="illus31">
<img src="images/illus31.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CHRIST OF THE ANDES.</p>
</div>

<p>At Mendoza a change is made to the broad
gauge trains of the Buenos Aires and Pacific
Railway, which will carry the traveller over the
remaining leagues of the journey. After leaving
the irrigated lands of this neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
another stretch of miserable scrub land is
crossed before the level pampas are entered.
From there to Buenos Aires the route is over
as level land as is to be found on the earth’s
surface. Hour after hour the train rolls over
these pampas, past small towns and through
great stretches of grain and alfalfa. At last,
after about a day and a half’s journey, the
train enters the suburbs of Buenos Aires, and
finally, with a shrill shriek, rolls into the Retiro
Station, which is the end of the trip.</p>

<p>Grand and wonderful as is the ride through
and across the Andes by railroad, the traveller
has missed one of the most striking features of
these solitudes. Almost immediately over the
tunnel, and nearly three thousand feet higher,
stands the famous statue, known as the Christ
of the Andes. This statue was erected in 1904
as a symbol of perpetual peace between the
two neighbouring nations. It was cast in
bronze from the cannon of the two nations,
which had been purchased through fear of
impending war. Its location is on the new
international boundary line that had just been
established by arbitration. Near it is a sign
with the words “CHILE” on one side, and
“ARGENTINA” on the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The figure of Christ is twenty-six feet in
height. In one hand it holds the emblem of the
cross, while the other is extended in a blessing,
and as if uttering the one magic word
“Peace.” On one side is a tablet with the
inscription: “Sooner shall these mountains
crumble into dust than the people of Argentina
and Chile break the peace to which they have
pledged themselves at the feet of Christ the
Redeemer.” On another side is the inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“He is our Peace</div>
<div class="verse">Who hath made both One.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cumbre, as this ridge is called, is the
highest point on the old trail. Travellers and
baggage were transported over it by mule-back
or in carriages, if the almost springless vehicles
could be called by such a name, during the
summer. It is a very zigzag trail up which
the carriages wound, where as many as twenty
twists and turns can be counted. On the downward
trip the horses ran and jumped, until the
timorous traveller began to have visions of
disaster. Accidents were rare, however, and
seldom was a vehicle overturned. Corners
were turned on two wheels, with only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
inches between the outside wheels and the edge
of the precipice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The clouds have voices, and the rivers pour</div>
<div class="verse">Their floods in thunder down to ocean’s floor;—</div>
<div class="verse">The hills alone mysterious silence keep.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most striking aspects which impress
the traveller crossing the Andes is the
terribly bleak and desolate outlook that they
present. Blades of grass here and there, or
perhaps a few stunted shrubs, are the only
signs of vegetation, for of trees there are none.
There seems to be no tree line, as in most
mountains. A huge expanse of yellow sand
and stone spreads out everywhere with peaks
rising up on every side in clearly defined and
rugged stratification, whose many-coloured
hues are almost bewildering to the eye. Great
torrents flow down the middle of the valleys,
the water being of a dull brackish hue. The
fording of these streams is a very dangerous
task for the explorer, as the torrents are exceedingly
rapid and full of deep, treacherous
holes.</p>

<p>On either side rise high peaks, and the traveller
is always interested in knowing the names
of these peaks. If he asks the average native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which is Aconcagua, or which Tupungato, he
is likely to be misinformed. There is to the
inexperienced mountain traveller a disappointment
when he finally has one of these lofty
peaks pointed out, and which he knows to be
above twenty thousand feet in height, because
he has expected, perhaps, to see an isolated
peak rearing its snowy head to the sky for a
distance of four miles or more above the level
on which he stands. The traveller forgets that
he himself is above the sea level almost half
that distance, before he gains a good clear view
of the higher peak. It is well established that
Aconcagua is the loftiest peak of the Andes,
but it is a little uncertain whether Tupungato
or the Mercedario is the second in height.</p>

<p>Ten thousand miles of majestic mountains
stretch from Alaska to Cape Horn—the
grandest range of mountains that can be found
on the earth’s surface. Throughout this series
of connected mountains, from the wilds of
Alaska to those of Patagonia, and including
the tropical plateaus of Ecuador, there are
many peaks that pierce the ethereal blue of
the skies. These are generally termed the
Sierras, which is the Spanish word for “saw,”
and the name is applied to mountains because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the fancied resemblance of their outlines to
that of the carpenter’s tool. A dim knowledge
of the majesty of mountains is obtained from
the smaller ranges of North America, such as
the Appalachian Mountains, but Mt. McKinley,
highest of North American mountains, must
yield in majesty to a number of peaks in the
lofty Andean range of mountains.</p>

<p>The lure of altitude seems to have caught
at the spirit of man from early times, and
led him struggling up almost unscalable peaks.
In recent years the fascination of mountain
climbing has become the romance of geography.
During the last half century daring explorers
have conquered more mountains, and
gathered more geological data, than in all the
previous centuries. Many lives have been lost
by devotees of this science, while pitting skill
and strength against nature and her secrets.
It has not been long since the elevations of the
southern half of this continent were an unknown
land; some lofty peaks were unexplored
and unnamed, and only dim suggestions of
their majesty and splendour had reached the
scientific world, but they now hold an interest
second to none. The loftiest peaks in the
world, excepting only the Himalayas, are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
along the western coast of South America.
They are in truth and reality the mountain
monarchs of the western world. In travelling
along the west coast of South America by
steamer the serrated backbone of the continent
is ever in sight, but its hazy outlines are at
such a distance that they give but a dim idea
of their real height from the steamer.</p>

<p>It remained for European mountain climbers,
men who received their schooling in the
Alps, to first conquer these lofty giants of nature.
Chimborazo (20,498 ft.), the “white
watcher of the western seas,” was the first to
yield its topmost secrets to Edward Whymper,
who fought his way up the rugged snow-clad
slopes to the very top. Next he conquered Cotopaxi
(19,615 ft.), and has given this volcano
the following recommendation: “Cotopaxi is
an ideal volcano. It comports itself, volcanically
speaking, in a regular and well-behaved
manner. It is not one of the provoking sort—exploding
in paroxysms and going to sleep directly
afterwards. It is in a state of perpetual
activity, and has been so ever since it had a
place in history.” Could any volcano in the
world show a stronger recommendation? It is
certainly an exemplary exponent of the volcanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
art. The explorer spent a night on the
very edge of the crater, peering into the cavernous
recesses that belched forth fire and
smoke, and must have been under its hypnotic
influence when inditing the above.</p>

<p>Going farther down the coast one reaches
the mighty peaks of Peru and Bolivia. An
American woman, Miss Annie S. Peck, has
scaled Mt. Huascaran (22,051 ft.), and holds the
unique record of having climbed higher than
any other woman. It was an achievement that
deservedly brought her great honour. Mt.
Illimani (21,490 ft.) is the loftiest peak in
Bolivia. It means “bright condor,” according
to the generally accepted derivation. Its
frozen crest was conquered by an Englishman,
Sir Martin Conway, and the Union Jack was
planted on the very summit. This mountain,
and its neighbour, Mt. Sorata (21,490 ft.), were
worshipped as gods by the Incas. A band of
superstitious natives, on learning his intention
to invade the sanctuary of their god, who dwelt
on Illimani, made an attempt to murder him,
but did not succeed in finding the party. Their
tradition asserts that a great cross of gold was
planted by the god on the summit, and they
were afraid these strangers would carry it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
away. At the foot of these mountains lies Lake
Titicaca, the sacred lake of the Incas.</p>

<p>The hardships endured on these climbs are
almost indescribable. The intense cold and the
rarefied air almost overcome the reserve vitality.
The weakening effect of diminished atmospheric
pressure is so enervating that exertion
can only be made a few steps at a time.
Headache, nausea and blood running from the
nose and ears are the more violent effects. It
is almost impossible to keep the feet from
being frost-bitten, and they have to be rubbed
occasionally to restore circulation. Says Mr.
Conway: “I asked myself more than once
whether the game was worth the candle, for
there was something so cold and unsympathetic
about the gloom and the ice and the bare
rocks, that for a time it weighed like a nightmare
upon my spirits.” The exhaustion is so
great that it is almost impossible to enjoy the
triumph of success. Speaking of this the same
explorer says: “The moment was one of satisfaction,
in that our toil ceased; but we had
no sense of triumph, nor was there breath
enough left in any of us for an exclamation of
joy in the hour of victory. Nothing was said
or done for several minutes; we just sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and rested.” As compensations, however,
there are frequently magnificent cloud effects.
Out of the white sea of snow there mount,
under the uplift of hot air currents, great towers
of cloud, which rise high into the air like
the smoke-discharge from a volcano. Huge
caves and cloud avenues are formed, wherein
dark-blue shadows gather, with occasionally a
high mountain top peeping forth like the foundation
stone of a gigantic cloud castle. Then
one’s vision is so broadened that he seems to
stand on the very top of the world itself.</p>

<p>In “Argentina and Her People of To-day,”
the writer has given an account of an ascent
of Aconcagua by Mr. E. A. Fitzgerald’s party,
and in this work some mention will be made of
the conquest of Tupungato by the same party.
This mountain can be seen clearly outlined
against the sky from the Pass of the Cumbre,
although it is distant fully thirty miles. The
route lies down through great masses of fallen
rock, the stones being on an average twice the
size of a man’s head. The stones are hard and
unworn by the forces of nature, presenting a
surface of sharp, jagged edges. It is an extremely
difficult pass to traverse because of
these rocks and danger of slipping, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
many cases would hurl the traveller many hundreds
of feet below. Sudden and violent
storms also rage around this mountain, which
renders the work of climbing still more difficult
and dangerous.</p>

<p>The distances, as in almost all mountain
climbing, are very deceiving, and what oftentimes
seems to be but the work of an hour may
require many hours to accomplish. Terrific
wind storms at times spring up, against which
it is almost impossible for a man to stand, and
this also adds to the dangers because of rocks
which are sometimes hurled down the mountain
sides. As the altitude increases the rarity of
the atmosphere and the consequently intense
cold render progress almost painful. It is necessary
for the mountain climber to stop every
few minutes to rest, as the cold and the wind
and rare atmosphere all combine to exhaust
the vitality. Three times Mr. Fitzgerald’s
party attempted the ascent of Tupungato, and
as many times were they compelled to abandon
it. Bleeding at the nose, frozen extremities
and weakness of the heart attacked the various
members of the party, and compelled them to
descend to lower altitudes. A fourth attempt,
however, was more successful. Each failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had taught something, so that each effort was
made under slightly better conditions and with
better equipment.</p>

<p>Here is the description by Mr. Vines, as it
appears in “The Highest Andes:” “I was on
the summit of Tupungato at last, and all my
efforts and disappointments were more than
repaid. I stood on a great mound in shape like
a pyramid, with a blunted top some two yards
wide rising several hundred feet above the general
surface of the dome. In the whole expanse
of sky around over ocean and land I could not
discern a single cloud. Only in the direction
of the Pacific a haze hung over the mountains.
In the brilliant air the spectacle that lay before
us was one of vast extent and grandeur.
Range upon range of mountains stretched
away towards the great plain of Santiago,
forty miles to the west. Far away, beyond the
hills that almost seemed to lie at our feet,
stretched the great waters of the Pacific, a
tract of blue ocean sparkling to the horizon,
and clearly visible, although the distance from
Tupungato to the seacoast is not less than
one hundred and thirty miles.</p>

<p>“The view from the top of Tupungato is in
many ways even finer than that obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Aconcagua. The expanse of ocean visible
toward the west is less vast, but there is ample
compensation in the outlook over the great
unknown plain on the eastern side. The Pampas
of Argentina stretch almost without a
break from our very feet to the South Atlantic
Ocean. The Andes seem to rise up from
Santiago in ever ascending gradations, until
at last they culminate in the immense mass of
Tupungato; behind, they fall brokenly away;
the mountains disappear; and a country almost
fen-like in its monotonous flatness succeeds.
The only break on the Argentine side
is that of the Sierra de la Plata, not many
more than twenty miles to the northeast. On
the Chilean side a score of dark peaks rear
their heads, a sinister array of precipitous impossibilities
from which any climber would
turn away in despair. To the north and to the
south the same great barriers arise. Looking
along this distinct and sharp edged chain to
the north and south it was hard to understand
how any frontier question between the republics
could come about.</p>

<p>“That Aconcagua was a high mountain we
well knew. We had all suffered from its
height, but, when near at hand, it was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
impossible to realize the vastness of its proportions.
Not so from where we now stood on
a pinnacle sixty miles away. I had long known
it was over four thousand feet higher than any
mountain within thirty miles of it, but it looked
ten thousand feet higher as it reared its immense
head and shoulders from amongst its
brothers, like some huge rock projecting out
of the waves of the sea. It stood before me
without rival, even the great ridges of Juncal
did not challenge it, although they were almost
thirty miles nearer. Behind Aconcagua, but
almost forty miles farther, and too far off for
comparison, I could see the white slopes of
Mercaderio.”</p>

<p>The guanaco and llama are animals which
are peculiar to the Andean regions. The
former is especially plentiful in Patagonia and
the southern Andean ranges, and many of them
are found in Southern Chile. To the natives
it means food, garments and tents, so that it is
hunted both for its meat and skin. Without
the guanaco the question of existence would
be a difficult one for those people to solve. The
vicuña, which is found in Northern Chile and
Bolivia, is of the same family but smaller and
more beautiful. Its fur is very valuable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
this animal is becoming scarce. The alpaca is
still smaller but flocks of this animal are maintained
as we herd sheep. The wool is almost
as fine and soft as silk, and, after a year’s
growth, becomes almost a foot long.</p>

<p>Of this animal family, which is closely allied
to the camel, the most important is the llama.
To one who has never seen the llama, except
in a menagerie or “zoo,” its real usefulness
is not apparent. Before the arrival of the
Spaniards on the west coast this gentle animal
was the only beast of burden known to the Inca
races. Thousands upon thousands of these
American camels were used by the natives in
transportation on the plateaus and across the
lofty mountains. Like the camel it can go for
days without food or drink. Even to-day, with
the introduction of the horse and mule, there
are probably as many or more llamas in use
than when Pizarro first landed on the shores
of South America. It is to the Andean native
what the reindeer is to the Lapp—milk and
flesh for food, skin for garments, hair for cloth,
sinews for thread, etc. Some are black, with
pretty little white kids, while others are almost
white and have black little llamas following
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The llama is one of the proudest animals in
the world. No matter where you see this aristocrat
of quadrupeds he holds his head high
up in the air, and looks out upon the earth as
though he owned it. Unlike the camel the
llama never sulks, although sometimes stubborn.
I have seen camels grunt and groan as
the loads were placed on their backs. They
will sometimes snap viciously at whoever
passes near, and at other times tears will flow
down a camel’s cheeks like a baby’s, so it is
said. The llama always carries his burden with
a proud air, scanning the landscape as he goes,
and pricking up his ears with interest at every
new or strange thing. He will carry a load of
just so much, about one hundred pounds. If
a greater load is strapped on his back than he
is accustomed to carry, the llama will neither
grunt nor groan, but he calmly kneels down
and will not move until the burden is lightened.</p>

<p>The llamas are the most common burden-bearing
animals in Bolivia and on the high
plateaus of Peru to-day. They will also be
found in the extreme northern part of Chile
on the Andean slopes. They form the great
freight-carriers in that portion of the Andes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
but cannot be worked successfully at a lower altitude
than two thousand feet. They are never
seen as near the coast as Lima, the Peruvian
capital. One will see llama trains every day
in La Paz, or the other towns of Bolivia, and
herds of these animals feeding on the plains
around Lake Titicaca are a common sight.
They are principally used in the carrying of
ore from the mines to the smelters or nearest
railway station. These little animals, which
are said to have the head of a camel, the body
of a sheep and the legs of a deer, are only
about four and one-half feet high and are
really beautiful creatures. They are gentle
when well treated, and become very fond of
their masters. The Indians pet them and talk
to them much as though they were human
beings. They sometimes dye the wool on the
backs in different colours, and tie bright-coloured
ribbons through holes which they make
in the llamas’ ears. The wool of the llama is
much coarser than that of sheep, but one can
see the Indian women spinning this wool into
threads, and then weaving it into cloth in many
places. It can easily be used in the coarse garments
worn by these people. If offended the
llama has a curious habit of spitting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
offender, which is rather disagreeable, as I
know from experience. As the llama is a cud-chewing
animal it seems to have this material
always ready for such occasions.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A LABORATORY OF NATURE</span></h2>

<p>The great desert of Tarapacá, which
stretches along the coast of Chile for hundreds
of miles, has proven to be the most valuable
of its entire possessions. And yet it is as barren
a desert as one could find on the surface
of the globe. Darwin thus describes a part of
it that he travelled over: “A complete and
utter desert. The road was strewn with the
bones and dried skins of the many beasts of
burden which had perished on it from fatigue.
Excepting the vulture which preys on the carcasses,
I saw neither bird, quadruped, reptile,
nor insect. On the coast mountains at the
height of about two thousand feet, where during
the season the clouds generally hang, a
very few cacti were growing in the clefts of
the rock, and the loose sand was strewn over
with a lichen which grows quite unattached.
In some parts it was of sufficient quantity to
tinge the sand, as seen from a distance, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
pale yellowish colour.” It is this dry climate
that has made possible the existence of the
great nitrate deposits along this coast. Rainfall,
even in moderate quantities, would dissolve
the nitrate. These deposits lie as a rule
just within the coast range of mountains.</p>

<p>Many theories have been advanced as to the
cause of this chemical composition. The most
ingenious one, perhaps, is that nitric acid is
formed by a flash of lightning passing through
a moist atmosphere, and electrical storms are
very common in the Cordilleras. The other
is that this coast was originally submerged in
the ocean, and was gradually upheaved. This
would leave a line of lagoons and marshes, in
which seaweed and other plants flourished.
As the lagoons successively dried up, the
plants would be decomposed and nitric acid
and iodine formed. This, united in combination
with the gypsum-yielding soda found
there, formed nitrate of soda. At any rate,
Nature, by some mysterious process, has
formed a chemical combination which has been
of inestimable value to the world in general.</p>

<p>This desert coast is not all productive of
nitrate. Some sections are valueless, and some
produce other chemical products. One can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
take a narrow-gauge train at Antofagasta and
travel inland for hundreds of miles across the
Andes and into the plateaus of Bolivia, and
the entire distance is almost as void of green
as the great Sahara Desert. Occasionally there
is a scrubby tree which looks forlorn in its
loneliness. There are salt plains which reach
to the hills on either side. In one place there
is a great salt field that is estimated to cover
more than eighty thousand acres. This produces
almost pure chloride of sodium in crystallized
form. The thickness of the salt layer
is not known, but some wells are as much as
eighty feet deep and the bottom of the deposit
has not been reached. It is a good quality of
salt. There are borax lakes along the route,
where enough borax can be secured to supply
the entire world. But it is from the beds of
nitrate of soda that the greatest wealth of this
region is secured. To it is due the prosperity
of all the ports from Pisagua to Taltal.</p>

<p>This chemical product, which we call Chilean
saltpetre, and which is locally known as
<i>salitre</i>, is found over hundreds of square
miles of territory. The only visible boundaries
between the different owners are marked
by white posts at the corners of the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
properties. With this exception there are no
marks whatever on the landscape, and no
signs of life except the factories, known as
<i>oficinas</i>, the numerous homes of the employees
made of corrugated iron, and the
workmen who are engaged in blasting and
hauling away this mineral. The nitrate beds
follow the coast line at a distance of from
fifteen to a hundred miles from the sea, generally
at an elevation of from four thousand
to five thousand feet, and in deposits which
vary from one to four miles in width. They
reach from near Antofagasta to a point some
distance north of Iquique. In some places the
deposits play out, but they reappear again a
little farther on. The fields that have been
exploited look as though they had been
ploughed over by gigantic ploughs, for immense
clods are scattered here and there wherever
the work has been carried on. On either side
of this strip there is simply a mass of sand
and rock, which extends from the sea to the
topmost peaks of the Andes. There is, however,
a wonderful colouring on the slopes of
the mountains, and one will see many tints of
violet, green, lemon and gray within the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitrate of soda is seldom found pure, and
the nitrate rock, called <i>caliche</i>, will vary from
ten to sixty per cent. of the pure mineral. In
some fields it is found on the top of the soil,
and in others it is as much as forty feet
beneath the surface, with the strata of salt
rock on the top of it. It varies considerably
in composition. Holes are dug or drilled
down through the <i>caliche</i> until a bed of gravelly
material is reached, into which charges
of dynamite or blasting powder are placed,
and the nitrate rock is thus loosened up.
When first exposed the nitrate is sometimes
as soft as cheese, but it hardens on contact
with the air. The lumps thus broken are then
dug out with picks or crowbars and hauled
in mule-carts to the <i>oficinas</i>.</p>

<p>There are many of these mills throughout
the nitrate fields, and they are busy places.
The lumps are first crushed, and are then
lifted by elevators and placed in huge tanks
filled with sea water. These tanks are encircled
by coils of steam pipes, which heat the
water that is poured in with the rock to any
desired temperature. Nitrate is soluble in
water, and this purifying process rests upon
the fact of its greater solubility in water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
heated to the boiling point, than the other salts
with which it is associated. When the water
has become supersaturated in the boiling
tanks, the nitrate of soda in solution is drawn
into shallow vats which are exposed to the air.
At this state it looks like pale maple molasses.
As it cools, the nitrate of soda crystallizes in
the vats, together with a little common salt and
a small amount of other impurities, and the
sides become covered with white sparkling
crystals like alabaster. These crystals are
then shovelled upon drying boards and exposed
to the sun for a time, after which they
are graded and put into bags weighing a little
over a hundred pounds each. This product,
which is ninety-six per cent. chemically pure
nitrate of soda, is then transported to the seacoast,
from whence it is shipped to Europe or
the United States, the latter country receiving
about one-fifth of the whole.</p>

<p>Another product of these nitrate beds is
iodine, which remains in the liquid after the
removal of the nitrate. This liquid is poured
into smaller pans, and is chemically treated
until the iodine is precipitated in the form of
a black powder. This is then heated in a retort
which changes it to a vapour, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
again condensed into beautiful violet crystals.
The iodine is packed in small casks which are
shipped with bullion and other valuables, for
each cask is worth several hundred dollars.
As the consumption of iodine is not very large
the <i>oficinas</i> refine only a part of the iodine in
order to keep up the price.</p>

<p>More than two million tons of nitrate of
soda were shipped from Chile last year, which
is the greatest amount that has ever been produced.
It has been found especially valuable
for increasing the growth of the sugar beets
in Europe, as it seems to provide the soil with
the essential elements for their growth. The
consumption in the United States is increasing
rapidly, and it is looked upon as the best fertilizer
provided by nature. According to horticultural
authorities it has been found especially
efficacious in stimulating the growth of
vegetables, such as cabbages, onions, carrots,
beets, etc., and for field crops of many kinds.
It is said that even the Incas of Peru were
acquainted with its value as a fertilizer. It
is also extensively used in the manufacture of
gunpowders and other high explosives, which
in itself makes a considerable demand.</p>

<p>The discovery of the value of nitrate as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
fertilizer was by accident. A poor Scotchman,
who lived near where Iquique now stands, had
a small garden which he cultivated with great
care. One day he noticed that a part of his
garden, which had been banked up with soil
containing this mysterious white substance,
flourished much more than the rest. This led
to experiments and some of this soil was sent
back to Scotland. The success of the experiments
that followed gradually led to the development
of the present industry, but the discoverer
died as poor as he was born. The first
nitrate works were established at Noria in
1826. It was not until after the war between
Chile and Peru that the industry reached great
proportions. Then an Englishman by the
name of North began its development and soon
afterwards became known as the “nitrate
king.” Other nitrate princes rose, and thrived
like the bonanza mining kings of Mexico and
Peru in their best days. Englishmen became
peers of that country through the influence of
colossal fortunes paved with saltpetre. In its
raw state the nitrate contains some properties
injurious to plant life, but these are removed.
As this process requires the latest modern machinery
to do the work economically, the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
has drifted into the hands of big combinations
of capital.</p>

<p>As the government of Chile exacts an export
tax on every sack of nitrate of soda exported,
the revenue from this source is enormous and
pays more than two-thirds of the expenses of
that extravagant government. Chile owns
practically all the nitrate of soda in the world.
Small quantities have been found elsewhere,
but in this region are the only deposits that
can be operated at a profit. Most of the nitrate
fields at one time belonged to Peru, but
Chile appropriated them as indemnity, after
a disastrous war was waged between the two
countries in 1880, in which Chile was victorious.
You can not meet a Peruvian anywhere
to-day who does not swear vengeance against
Chile, for thus robbing his country of her
greatest source of wealth.</p>

<p class="caption">LOADING NITRATE.</p>
</div>

<p>English capital has developed this great
industry in Chile, and no less than one hundred
million dollars in British sovereigns have been
invested in these dreary wastes. Almost one
hundred million dollars’ worth of this <i>salitre</i>
has been exported in a single year. The ports
are at all times filled with vessels which have
brought coal and merchandise, and are awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a load of nitrate. It is seldom that the
Stars and Stripes are seen floating from a
masthead, but it is a welcome sight to an American.
The profits for a few years were so
great that an overdevelopment followed, and
the price greatly dropped. Then a trust agreement
was, arrived at limiting the output, but
even that was not a success and the production
is again unlimited. The population of the
nitrate district is a cosmopolitan one, and represents
almost every nation on the face of the
earth. It gives employment to many thousands
of persons. A homesick and stranded
American is not an uncommon sight.</p>

<p>It is estimated that at the present rate of
mining the known fields of nitrate of soda in
Chile will be exhausted in fifty years, or less.
The official board of engineers has recently
reported to the Chilean government that there
are in sight four and a half million quintals
(220.4 lbs.) of nitrate in the deposits of the
country. A previous estimate had fixed the
visible quantity at less than half that amount.
It is doubtful whether either of those estimates
is very reliable. At any rate the government
and owners of the <i>oficinas</i> are pushing the
sales in every way, and exploiting the use and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
value of nitrate as though it was inexhaustible.
It is possible that similar deposits may be
found on the Sahara Desert, or some of our
own desert lands where similar climatic and
atmospheric conditions exist. The value of
nitrate lands in Chile has risen rapidly in recent
years, and nearly all the undeveloped
fields are now owned by the Chilean government,
which auctions them off as the need for
money arises.</p>

<p>The nitrate industry has very naturally overshadowed
all other mining enterprises in Chile,
and especially in the northern section. And
yet there are many more mining industries
even in that part of the republic. The Spaniards
cared for nothing but gold and silver and
set thousands of Indians at work in the mines
at Tucapel, Valdivia, and Quillota. The Malga
Malga mines, near the latter town, and the
Madre de Dios (mother of God) mines, near
Mariguina, were the best producers of the yellow
metal. The district around Taltal also
produced gold and silver. By the primitive
processes of the Spaniards only a portion of
the ore was extracted. The refuse has since
been refined, and even houses have been torn
down that had been constructed of the by-products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the old amalgamation process.
Some of this refuse contained as much as sixty
ounces of pure silver to the ton. The total production
of silver and gold to-day is not great
when compared with the other gold-producing
nations. Among the best mines now being
worked are the Caracoles silver mines, which
are inland from Antofagasta a little over one
hundred miles, and the Inca Caracoles mines,
which are fifty miles further inland. The total
output of these mines during the years they
have been worked reaches big figures, but the
balmiest days have passed. Some of the workings
have reached a depth of twenty-five hundred
feet. The ores are generally chlorides or
iodides, with mixtures of sulphides, but pockets
of almost pure silver are occasionally found.</p>

<p>Copper production is next in value after
nitrate. There are smelting plants at Caldera,
Cerro Blanco, Jarilla, Antofagasta, and other
places. Central Chile is the copper country,
although Lota is one of the greatest producers.
The surface oftentimes shows the green outcroppings
of the copper deposits. The superior
attraction of the nitrate fields has at times
caused a scarcity of labour there so that the
development has been greatly hampered. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the copper industry has been a fairly
profitable and steady one. The annual output
ranges from thirty-five thousand to forty thousand
tons, but it is doubtless capable of considerable
further development, with the aid of
more modern methods and the installation of
the latest machinery.</p>

<p>Iron ore has been found in only small quantities.
Chile has the best coal mines in South
America, which, in 1909, produced a little less
than a million tons, not quite half of the consumption.
Coal was first discovered at Lota
more than a century ago, but the deposits were
not worked until a half-century later. The only
mines now being worked are in the provinces
of Concepción and Arauco. As small veins
have been found at Punta Arenas, it may be
that the seams of coal run all the way between
those points. It is rather an inferior
quality of bituminous coal. More than a million
tons are imported yearly, of which a little
more than one-half comes from England and
the balance from Australia. The shipping rate
is very low as the boats come after cargoes of
nitrate and will carry coal at a very cheap rate
rather than be obliged to make the long outward
journey in ballast.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PEOPLE</span></h2>

<p>The people of Chile are descendants of
Spaniards and native races. About one-third
of the entire population are pure white. The
Spaniards who came here were Basques and
Aragonese—a hardy and industrious people
who made thrifty farmers and merchants.
They are among the best class of Spaniards,
for they are much more energetic and have
less of the Moorish admixture than those from
Southern Spain. These people were not a
mere army of occupation, but they set about
developing the real resources of the country.
The native element too were probably the
hardiest of any of the native races of South
America. Notwithstanding the difference in
numbers, the Creoles, the name given to the
descendants of Spanish immigrants, rule the
country absolutely and own the most of the
property. In few countries have the landed
aristocracy exercised such absolute power as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in this narrow and elongated republic. The
half-breeds form the labouring class of Chile,
and one will find those two classes all over the
republic, with the lines between the two
strongly marked. There is no clearly defined,
well-developed middle class.</p>

<p>The Chileans delight to call themselves the
“English of the Pacific,” or the “Yankees
of South America.” In neither case is the
comparison a perfect one, although they are
probably the hardest working race on that continent.
The Chileno is very proud of the progress
that his country has made, and this pride
sometimes carries him to peculiar extremes.
It at least causes the average Chileno to become
more or less of a braggart. He is inclined
to take all the credit for this advancement
to himself, when, in fact, much of it has
been due to the English and German elements
in the country. His ideals of life, however, are
not German or English, but rather French,
with its love of polished surface and general
dislike for disagreeable truths. Peru has retained
more of the old culture and grace of the
Spanish cavalier than Chile, but the latter is
far more robust. The climate of Chile is remarkably
healthful, and it has produced a vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
race. This is a general truth, whether
applied to the race amalgamated with the virile
Araucanian of the south, or to the mixture
with the more delicate and refined descendant
of the Inca at the north. The ordinary <i>roto</i>
is tough and wiry, and capable of prolonged
fatigue on the poorest and simplest of food.</p>

<p>The creoles have inherited all the traditions
of the original <i>conquistadores</i>—love, sentiment
and passion, and the habit of intrigue. It
is not uncommon to see in a family the natural
children of one or the other parent, generally of
the father, living side by side with the legitimate
children. The percentage of illegitimacy
is very large, as shown by the government statistics,
for they do not attempt to cover up this
flagrant fault. The café and club life of the
cities appeals to the Chileans, and they have
acquired a love of alcoholic stimulants. The
light wines, with which most of the people of
Spanish blood are content, do not satisfy, but
they must have the stronger alcoholic beverages.
As a result there is much drunkenness
in Chile, more than in the neighbouring republics.
It is an unfortunate fact, but true, as all
who have made a study of the subject agree.
The first establishment in a new community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is generally a factory for the production of
<i>aguardiente</i>, brandy made from sugar cane,
wheat or some vegetable. Some of it is as bad
and ruinous to the health as it is cheap.</p>

<p>Chile has perhaps suffered in recent years
from too great prosperity. Like the child born
with a silver spoon in its mouth, this country
found itself with seemingly inexhaustible treasure
within its borders. Its training under the
autocracy of Spain was not a good education
in representative and democratic government.
Then came the wealth of the nitrate fields,
after a successful war with Peru. The government
coffers were filled to overflowing with
practically no effort on the part of the government,
and little tax contributed by the average
citizens. As a result, the habit of office holding
and the desire for sinecures have been a bad
thing for the country. The enormous revenue
has been used up, and there is little to show
for much of it. In public offices the officials are
oftentimes almost tumbling over each other,
and everything is checked and counter checked
over and over again. Positions are created
and no equipment for carrying out the work
provided. So long as the government does not
complain the appointee does not, and many salaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of that kind are paid year after year for
services unrendered. I verily believe that the
official work of the government could be carried
on with less than one-half the force employed.
But the members of Congress have
friends, or sons of friends, who must be provided
for, and the government revenues are
thus subject to a constant drain.</p>

<p>Politics is the most genteel occupation in
Chile to-day, for the army, navy and church,
formerly so popular with the Spaniards, no
longer appeal to the Chileno of good and influential
family. A government appointment
means easy or no work, fair pay, and less danger
than martial occupations, where the call
to arms might come at any time. It is not because
of lack of courage, for no braver or more
courageous people can be found in South America
than these same Chileans, who sit in the
cafés and drink their spirits or puff tobacco
wrapped in thin paper. With the Chilean a
valiant spirit covers a multitude of sins. His
greatest boast is the courage of his race. He
is willing to make almost any kind of a personal
sacrifice for his country, if the occasion
demands, but to pay taxes is a hardship.</p>

<p>The Chileans resemble very much the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in some of their characteristics. One of these
is their love of fighting, and the Chileans have
made about the best soldiers of any of the
South American people. They have an intense
spirit and patriotism, which has shown itself
in their wars and revolutions. In addition to
the Spanish blood a large percentage have
more or less of the blood of the Araucanian
Indians, who were the most stubborn race to
conquer of any that the Spaniards encountered
in South America. As soldiers the Chileans
have no sense of mercy, and this characteristic
has shown itself in all of their wars. They are
impetuous, impulsive, passionate and generous,
but have very little self-control. Many of them
fight simply for the love of fighting, just as do
many of the Irish, who seem to scrap simply
for the sake of scrapping.</p>

<p>The Chileno as a rule has a fiery temper.
He loves a fight. It is not a fist fight that he
will indulge in, but it must be a fight with revolvers,
or, better yet, with knives. The knife
is an indispensable equipment with the <i>roto</i>.
It used to be said that as many lives were lost
in a Chilean fair as in a decent battle. It is
a sad fact that murders are extremely frequent,
and scarcely a day passes in Santiago or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Valparaiso without some fatal affray. <i>Aguardiente</i>
may be placed at the bottom of most of
these, just as rum is the primary cause of most
of the murders in the United States. It inflames
the naturally hot temper of the race and
brings out all the passions of envy, hatred and
jealousy. The death penalty is seldom inflicted,
although sentence is frequently imposed.
The prisoners are kept in confinement,
and their sentence commuted from time to time.
If the convicted one belongs to a family of
prominence, he will eventually be released; if
of poorer origin, he may be sent to some remote
section of the country and set to work. Among
the <i>rotos</i> there is a general contempt for death,
which also adds to the prevalence of murders,
and sometimes of brigandage in the mountains.
A little judicious weeding out of some of these
criminals would not be a bad thing for the
country.</p>

<p>The <i>rotos</i> constitute the masses in Chile. In
the country the <i>roto</i> is a peon or inquilino,—an
agriculturalist; in the city he is a longshoreman—a
roustabout. In all of them there
is a race admixture with the white race. Of
the native races this mixture is not all Araucanian,
for there are at least ten distinct aboriginal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
tribes. This <i>roto</i> is not always an
agreeable companion, for he is not generally
so cleanly as he might be. But he is not a hopeless
element in society. His vices are generally
the result of a lack of restraining power of the
passions. His virtues are independence and
industry. He is a prejudiced individual, and
persists in his prejudices. He is intensely
patriotic, and has fought the battles of his
country—and always in the ranks. Neither
in the army nor in the navy has he been permitted
to rise above this position.</p>

<p>Peonage is the common form of labour on
the large landed estates, although it is somewhat
more favourable to the labourer than in
Mexico or Peru. The labourer, or peon, is
rented a small tract of land, including a little
hut, and is allowed to grow his own vegetables.
He may also be allowed to pasture a few animals.
In return, he must work, or provide
labour, for the <i>hacendado</i> as required. For
this he is paid a certain small wage. The landlord
allows him credit for supplies at the store,
which is invariably a part of the establishment,
at prices which mean a good profit. As long as
he is indebted to the owner, the peon must stay
on the place. If he is even in his account, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
is at liberty to depart wherever the notion
takes him.</p>

<p>The proprietor is a magistrate, and has
power to put a man in irons if he deems it
necessary. As a rule the peons do not change
employers often, and it is seldom that one is
compelled to leave. They are not ambitious,
and a living, permission to celebrate holidays,
and, perhaps, get drunk occasionally, constitutes
their idea of happiness. So long as these
conditions exist the peon does not seek anything
better, for, to his mind, such a condition
is ideal in itself. He has,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent3">“The sun, and moon and air,</div>
<div class="verse">And never a bit of the burthen of care;</div>
<div class="verse">And with all our caring, what more have we?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The landlord, on his part, is satisfied, for he
has labour at hand at a small cost, just as his
fathers had before him. It is true that it takes
more labourers of this kind to accomplish a
given amount of work, but the total cost is still
comparatively small.</p>

<p>The <i>rotos</i> in the city are not attractive individuals.
Their appearance is often hard and
repellent, and the stranger is almost inclined to
fear them. They are restless, too, and serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
labour disturbances have occurred in the cities,
for trade unionism has entered the social fabric
there. A few years ago a wild mob resulted
from a strike against the steamship companies,
and it took to destroying property after the
most approved fashion. The offices of the Chilean
companies were burned, but foreign property
was not disturbed, although the grievance
was the same. Santiago has also had a grievous
experience with strikes. This was due to
a tax upon cattle imported from Argentina,
which resulted in an advance in meat prices.
Rioting and the destruction of property were
again the forms it took.</p>

<p>These instances show that a social question
has been developed in Chile as well as
other countries. How much is due to socialistic
propaganda, it is difficult to estimate. It
is probably only a protest against the condition
in which this class finds itself. The <i>roto</i>
holds a grievance against the Church, also,
because that organization possesses immense
wealth and pays no taxes. He feels that he
does the real work, but is always kept in an
inferior station, a ball to be kicked and rolled
around at the will of the governing and military
classes. It is no doubt true that the <i>roto</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
has many legitimate grievances, and the government
will eventually be compelled to recognize
them. Thousands of <i>rotos</i> have emigrated
across the Andes to Argentina, being
drawn there by the higher wages that can be
secured. Whether the movement will become
greater or not, the future alone will reveal.</p>

<p>The <i>rotos</i> of Chile work hard when they
work, but they are generally improvident and
do not think of saving money. The only occasion
which leads the average <i>roto</i> to save any
money is the prospect of a holiday ahead, for
which he will sometimes save a little surplus,
in order that he may have sufficient funds to
celebrate the occasion in the way he thinks it
should be celebrated,—and that is by carousing.
His idea is that he must imbibe plenty
of liquor in order to get the proper effect.
This is not universally true, for the savings
banks of the country show that thousands of
those in the unskilled occupations have at least
small bank accounts. As wages are comparatively
small, this indicates considerable thrift.</p>

<p>Drinking in Chile has become a curse. Monday
is said by employers of labour to be a very
unsatisfactory day, because so many of their
employees have not yet recovered from the dissipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the previous day. This is likewise
true after some national holiday, such as the
18th of September, for which occasion five
days are set aside, as this is the Chilean 4th
of July. The better element of the Chileans
have long realized that the drunkenness incident
to these celebrations is a serious menace
to the country, for, on the day following, the
hospitals are oftentimes filled with wounded.
There are always several deaths by violence,
because every Chilean peon does not consider
himself properly dressed until he has a knife
placed in his belt where it can be easily reached.</p>

<p>To correct the errors resulting from this excessive
drinking, a society has been formed in
Chile, which has become quite prominent, and
is called La Liga Contra el Alcoholismo, which,
literally translated, means an organization
against excessive alcoholism. It is not, as one
might think, a prohibition or total abstinence
society, for such an organization would be very
unpopular among all classes of Chileans. Its
object is to restrain as much as possible, both
by legislation and persuasion, the appetite for
liquor, and cultivate habits of moderation in
its indulgence. The courts have been asked to
impose certain restriction upon the sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
liquors, and employers of labour have been
asked to change the method of paying their
help.</p>

<p>“The women of Chile are as pious as the
men are proud,” says a writer. Nowhere will
one find women more conscientious in the performance
of their religious duties. The morning
mass is always crowded with women and
children in attendance upon these ceremonies.
One is impressed by the piety of the Chilenas
when he sees the <i>penitentas</i>—as women who
are doing penance for some sin are called.
Skirts of white flannel are worn with the <i>manta</i>
by these women. They will be seen hovering
around the churches, where they will sometimes
rest on their knees for hours before the
altar of some saint. They may be clustered
around the confessional awaiting absolution
from the confessor. Some of these women
have committed sin, while others are simply
carrying out a vow, in order to perfect themselves
and thus get nearer to heaven. They
will go about the street with downcast eyes and
recognize no one—not even a friend. Among
these <i>penitentas</i> one will find women of high
social rank, as well as young girls of wonderful
beauty. Those who feel that this more simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
method will not atone for their sin, or raise
them to a state of absolute perfection, retire
to a convent in the suburbs of the city, called
the Convent of the Penitentes. There they
dress in sackcloth, feed on mouldy bread, and
scourge themselves with whips. These scenes
are more common during Lent, or at the end
of the social season. It is said, however, that
the number of women doing penance is becoming
less each year. It is also a fact that one
never sees a man humiliating himself and
proclaiming his wrong-doing in this public
way.</p>

<p>The women of Chile, the Chilenas, are of
medium height and well formed. The real
slender type is the exception, and the average
maiden is well-rounded and plump. As the
women grow older they run to adipose tissue,
and many of the matrons are decidedly fat.
They look healthy, and a vigorous body carries
with it a corresponding appetite, and this, together
with little exercise, is responsible for the
later development. The type is quite uniform.
Black hair, and dark, lustrous eyes are almost
universal. Dress is as much sought after by
the Chileans as in any part of the world. Paris
creations are in demand by those who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
afford them, and the others purchase the best
gowns that their means will permit.</p>

<p>Etiquette is very carefully observed by the
Chileans. There is an etiquette for a man
toward a woman, and one for a person of a
lower rank toward one better born. And all
are scrupulously observed. A man must always
speak to a woman first. A girl of the
better families could not appear on the street
alone without her mother, aunt or servant with
her. A little nurse girl, though of no earthly
use, is a sufficient compliance with the requirement
of etiquette. Her best young man, instead
of being a protection, would be an occasion
for the severest tongue-wagging. These
things are the inherited restraints upon the
liberty of women which have come down from
a thousand years of custom.</p>

<p>A young man and young woman have little
opportunity to become acquainted before marriage.
In many instances the young people
have very little to say about the matter, supposed
to be one of hearts, and are scarcely consulted.
About the only way he can learn anything
about the disposition of his intended is
for a young man to bribe the servants and thus
get first-hand information. He can never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
her except in the parlour, surrounded by all
the family, or at dances, where she is always
under the eye of her chaperon. In fact, during
the whole of her maidenhood a girl is closely
watched, and is seldom permitted to be out of
sight of her mother’s vigilant eye. The girl
naturally thinks that these restrictions are unnecessary,
but mamma thinks that they are
essential, father approves, and so the custom
remains. The lover bears the name of <i>novio</i>,
and his sweetheart is <i>novia</i>. Neither dare pay
any attention to another, and for a <i>novio</i> to
dance with any other girl than his <i>novia</i> would
be a direct offence, and probably cause a breaking
of the engagement.</p>

<p>Every girl looks forward to marriage as her
sole career. The independence of the American
girl has not influenced her, and the suffragette
agitation has not reached Chile. Marriage
is the beginning of freedom for a woman,
for up to that time she is practically kept in
a cage, or is tied by a string to some guardian.
When the priest performs the wedding ceremony,
however, the shackles are broken. Nevertheless
they make good wives, for their tastes
are domestic; and they make good mothers,
to whom children are welcome, and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of them the better they are satisfied. Musical
clubs, literary clubs and missionary societies
do not exist to interfere with domestic duties.
A houseful of servants are usually kept to do
the work, for each servant will only do the particular
duties for which he or she was hired.
The groom often takes his bride to his father’s
house, and one will frequently find several
families living under the same roof in
seeming peace and harmony.</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUP OF CHILEAN GIRLS.</p>
</div>

<p>The colonies of Chile, such as Valdivia,
Osorno and others around Lake Llanquihue,
are principally made up of Germans and Dutch.
Most of these were poor and ignorant when
they came to their new homes, and some have
remained so. They have built up several prosperous
communities, however, and there they
will be found, a quiet, peaceable and an intelligent
population. This frontier had quite a
boom at one time, and thousands were attracted
here by the seductive literature sent
out by the wily agents stationed in Europe.
Town after town sprang up. Men who had
never done a day’s work on a farm and ne’er-do-wells
came over. Few of them had any
money. For several years there was much
hardship. The government was not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
prompt in carrying out its pledges, for the
officials could not see why “to-morrow” would
not do just as well. Some finally returned, and
others drifted into the larger cities. But many
were very successful and now have good farms
to show as a reward for their industry. After
the war with Peru many of the disbanded soldiers
were granted tracts of land here. Considerable
lawlessness followed, as they robbed
the unresisting Germans of their cattle and
other animals. The outlaws being in league
with the officials, no redress could be secured,
and the colonists complained with good reason.
These conditions have ended. The Teutons
have generally remained apart from the Chileans,
and the percentage of intermarriage has
been small. Some have not even mastered the
Spanish tongue, and few take any part in the
government. These two races may become
amalgamated eventually, and it would be a
good thing for Chile to receive into its fold this
sturdy Teutonic blood.</p>

<p>Of all the nationalities, other than Spanish,
that have entered Chile, the British is the most
prominent and has been the most prosperous.
It is likewise the most numerous. Britons,
such as the O’Higgins, Lord Cochrane and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Prat, have helped to fight Chile’s battles,
and their financiers have advanced the money
that has developed her resources. Hence it is
not surprising that one will find the characteristics
of that tight little island impressed upon
the country, and, in many instances, upon the
people. English names are quite common
among prominent Chilean families, for they
have become nationalized. Men who came
there a generation or two ago married the
daughters of Chile, and the families are essentially
Chilean, although bearing English names.
Many of these English-Chilenos are very prominent.
One man, who had been a member of
the Chilean Congress, told me that one-fourth
of the members of that body, at the time of his
membership, had had English fathers or grandfathers.
The progress of Chile in many lines
can be traced to this influence.</p>

<p>Valparaiso bears many British characteristics.
A walk along the principal business
streets will show almost as many English signs
as those in Spanish. The English language
will be heard on every corner. The Anglo-Saxon
face is a familiar sight. In the banking
and shipping quarters nearly everything is
British, with a sprinkling of the Teuton. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Iquique and Antofagasta it is still more
marked, for the nitrate and copper interests
are almost entirely in the hands of English
capital. Each year scores of young men come
out from the home land and accept positions
with the banks, railroads and manufacturing
interests. Some of them remain permanently,
and others claim only a temporary domicile.
Most of them do not assimilate very readily
with the Spaniard. There is both a racial and
religious antagonism. This wears away after
a while with many, for they are shut off from
home ties and the restraints of society.</p>

<p>Homes in the proper sense are not open to
these aliens, and their quarters are devoid of
home comforts. Hence the young Englishmen
seek companionship where they are sure to be
welcome. Always criticising the loose morals
of the Chileans, they generally do nothing to
better conditions, and oftentimes end by taking
a part in the dissipation. They frequent the
bars and clubs and indulge in great quantities
of strong liquors. Shut off by social customs
from the better homes, they oftentimes unite
themselves with the freer and easier strata of
society. As an English writer expresses himself
of his own countrymen: “We have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
much to aid in developing the country along
certain defined lines; but we have done little
or nothing to ingratiate ourselves with the people,
or to aid in raising the moral tone of those
we affect to despise. The English in Chile
commonly remain like a bed of cabbages in a
Chilean flower-garden—self-satisfied and self-aggrandizing,
usurping all the nourishment
they can obtain, and neither specially ornamental
nor specially interesting.” Chile has
provided homes and, in many instances, fortunes
for the English, and they should return
more to such a hospitable mother than has been
done heretofore.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">AN UNCONQUERABLE RACE</span></h2>

<p>The most indomitable of the native races in
the New World, with the exception of the red
men of North America, have been the Araucanians
of Chile. They are the proudest, richest
and bravest of the Indians of South America.
At the time of the conquest this race occupied
the greater part of Chile, and had spread
across the Andes into a part of Patagonia,
which country they shared with the Tehuelches,
the so-called giants. For three hundred years
they waged a successful warfare against the
Spanish invaders, and the republic of Chile
which later succeeded the Spanish province.
It was not until 1884 that they were finally
conquered, and submitted to the Chilean government
after certain rights and privileges
were guaranteed to them. So long as the Chileans
attempted to conquer the Indians by brute
force they failed, just as had the Spaniards
before them. It was not until some tact and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
judgment were used that any real progress
was made in the subjugation of these people.</p>

<p>According to the early account the Araucanians
were given to agriculture, and the valleys
south of the present city of Santiago teemed
with an industrious and energetic race. The
Incas had spread their sovereignty south of
Santiago as far as the Maule River, and this
probably accounted in part for the agricultural
development there. Some writers claim that
the Incas had enslaved the Araucanians and
compelled them to do their work. At any rate
the Spaniards encountered little opposition in
their conquest before that river was reached.
The fact is that these people were really divided
into three different tribes. The tribes
that lived along the coast were fishermen, those
that lived on the higher lands were hunters,
while those who occupied the more fertile valleys
were agriculturists. It was estimated by
some of the early writers that there were at
that time no less than a half million of these
Indians. This estimate is no doubt excessive,
and half that number would be nearer the
truth. They knew not the use of any metals,
excepting silver, which they worked into various
forms. Silver breastplates were worn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the wives of the <i>caciques</i>, or chiefs, which told
of the number of their children, as large families
were their boast. They also wore large
crescent earrings and great silver suns as
breastpins, with hieroglyphics upon them which
told of a nature worship. Bracelets formed of
a multiplicity of minute silver beads were also
fashioned very attractively, and in later years
silver stirrups were manufactured for the head
men. Even to-day this race is noted for its
silver work.</p>

<p>Down upon this stronghold of the Araucanians
came Pedro de Valdivia, in 1550, with
two hundred horsemen and some other troops.
This force no doubt made an imposing appearance,
as it marched along with their coats of
mail, helmets, swords and spears flashing in
the sunlight. The only firearms were clumsy
arquebuses borne by the infantry, and fired
from a wooden support by the aid of a fuse
only kept alight with great difficulty. And yet
the Spanish soldiers at that time were considered
to be the best in the world. They continually
marched in order of battle, preceded by
an advanced guard and carrying their baggage
in the centre. From the time he reached the
river Itata his march was a continuous conflict,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
although he managed to get as far as the River
Bio-Bio.</p>

<p>How two hundred men were able to make
this trip through a thickly populated country
can be explained by reason of the superior
weapons and armour of the Spaniards, as well
as the fact that they used horses. These animals
at that time were unknown among the
native races, and inspired them with terror
just as they did the Aztecs in Mexico. The
Indians had only wooden lances, arrows of the
simplest manufacture, and clubs; and yet they
managed to stand against the Spaniards at
times until hundreds of them were slain. On
one occasion the Spanish records say that Valdivia
was beset with twenty thousand Indians.
As fast as one body of the Indians was routed
another took their place. Compact masses of
the Indians at times surrounded the Spaniards.
The horses were clubbed, and this together
with the war-cries of the attacking force created
a terrible confusion. When the Indians
were finally beaten off the ground was literally
covered with the dead bodies of their comrades.
Every Spaniard was wounded. This battle is
known as that of Andalien.</p>

<p>The cruelty of the Spaniards in this invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was something terrible at times. After the
battle of Penco, where, according to the chroniclers,
forty thousand Indians attacked the invaders,
Valdivia cut off the nose and right
hand of two hundred prisoners, and sent them
back to terrorize their comrades in this mutilated
condition. They treated the natives with
absolute contempt, and endeavoured to reduce
them to abject slavery. Valdivia practically
had no choice in the matter. Each soldier had
to be paid a grant of land, with a certain number
of slaves. The soldiers were of a fierce and
intractable character, and it was almost impossible
to maintain any sort of discipline among
them. Valdivia founded the city of Imperial,
fortified it and employed the natives in washing
the gold found in this district. He also
established the city of Villa Rica, which means
the rich village, and was so named because of
the wealth and fertility of that valley, and
another town that was named after himself.
In fact he endeavoured to establish a string of
fortified outposts throughout that entire section
of the country. The Indians were parcelled
out among the conquerors, Valdivia retaining
for himself about forty thousand. Although
at this time the Spanish population of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the valley did not exceed one thousand, yet
they were able after a while to force the Indians
to do their work. The men were attended
by a numerous retinue of servants wherever
they went, and even the women wanted to be
followed by a large concourse of slaves when
they attended church. Rank and importance
seemed to be indicated by the number of
menials.</p>

<p>The end, however, was not long in coming.
It was due to an Indian boy, named Lautaro,
who had been raised in the household of Valdivia
himself, that their freedom was finally
obtained. He had learned to manage horses,
and to use the Spaniards’ weapons. Taking
some of these animals, he joined his people and
stirred up a general insurrection. A public
assembly of the tribes was called, and Lautaro
presented a definite plan for a campaign
against the enemy. When Valdivia arrived
on the scene to put this revolt down he found
some of the towns already in ashes. Lautaro,
although only twenty-one years of age, had
shown a genius for war and was in command,
and had already established some discipline
among his troops. Not a single Spaniard escaped
in a battle, or series of skirmishes, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was fought, although thousands of the Indians
fell. Contrary to the example set by the Spaniards
Lautaro simply killed his prisoners by
beheading them without any preliminary torture.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Valdivia himself was captured by the
Indians. That general at once offered him two
hundred sheep for his release, and promised to
withdraw all of his troops from their territory.
The Indian caciques, however, would not consent
to this, and, at a prearranged signal, one
of the Indian soldiers struck him on the head
with a club and killed him. It is said that his
body was afterwards eaten by the assembled
caciques, in order to give them heart in the
struggle against the Spaniards. This seems to
have been a custom among many primitive
races.</p>

<p>Thus was a struggle begun which lasted for
three centuries. During this time the Spaniards
frequently penetrated the country of the
Indians, and were as many times driven back
again. The number of horses owned by the
Indians soon increased, and they also secured
many arms from the slain Spaniards, so that
by the latter part of the sixteenth century they
were in a better position to fight. In 1599 they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
were able to muster no less than two thousand
mounted troops. They had also developed
herds of cattle and sheep from original stock
secured from the Spaniards. Plagues broke
out at different times, and these, together with
the numbers lost in battle, greatly decimated
the natives.</p>

<p>The death of Valdivia was the beginning of
a heroic age for the Indians. The whole country
was soon in arms, and the Spaniards were
ousted from most of their settlements. Villagran,
successor of Valdivia, was driven out of
the valley, but soon afterwards returned with
reinforcements and commenced a war of extermination.
He employed bloodhounds as auxiliaries,
and these animals destroyed many Indians,
especially women and children. He destroyed
the crops wherever possible, and this
brought on starvation and plague. He rebuilt
some of the forts and established others, for
he was at the head of a splendidly appointed
army of several thousand men who had come
there from Peru.</p>

<p>At one time Villagran hung thirty caciques.
One of the chiefs requested that he be hanged
on the highest tree, in order that his countrymen
might see him dying for his country. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
chief, who died a natural death, asked
that his body be burned, in order that he might
arise to the clouds and continue fighting the
dead Spaniards who dwelt there. At the same
time he asked that a successor be chosen, in
order that the war might be continued against
those below. In a later battle the Indians dug
pitfalls for the cavalry, and, when the horses
stumbled into these, they fell upon the riders
and almost annihilated them. The Spanish
leader cut off the feet of many prisoners in
order to terrify their compatriots. Nevertheless,
in spite of these cruelties and some successes
on the part of the invaders, the Indians
were victorious, so that the Spaniards
were again obliged to withdraw. A severe
earthquake, which occurred at this time, also
destroyed some of the town, as the shocks continued
for several months.</p>

<p>In 1599 seven Spanish cities were destroyed
by the Indians. The city of Imperial was besieged
for sixteen months, during which time
the greatest heroism was shown by both besieged
and besiegers. The Indians ingeniously
diverted the river that supplied the town with
water. It finally succumbed and was destroyed.
Another Spanish city held out against the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for three years, until practically all those
within the fortifications were slain, starved to
death or captured when seeking food. In one
year there were no less than twenty-four murderous
Indian raids. Thus after a conquest of
half a century no permanent results could be
seen. The Indians had learned much from
their oppressors and were better fighters.
They, as well as the Spaniards, had captured
many prisoners, and the Spanish women had
been taken over as wives by the caciques. As
a result of this prolonged conflict the Spanish
government established the river Bio-Bio as
the frontier line, which in itself was quite a
victory for the Indians.</p>

<p>In 1641 the independence of Araucania was
acknowledged. A few years later, however,
the treaty was broken by the Spaniards in their
slave-hunting expeditions. Another war of
conquest was also begun. The events of the
preceding century were repeated in a number
of instances, until 1703, when the King of
Spain ordered the raids into the Indian country
to cease. For a half century or more there
was comparative peace, although the Spaniards
conducted some desultory raids against
the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>During the war of independence some of
these natives fought on the side of Spain, and
others were found on the side of the revolutionists.
As soon as independence was secured,
however, the authorities began to use
the same methods towards these people that
the Spaniards had, and thus alienated whatever
good will might have been felt by them.
Several more or less severe combats followed
which really made it a local civil war. It was
not until Colonel Saavedra adapted a more
conciliatory policy that bloodshed ceased. The
heroic age of the Araucanians had probably
passed away, and the later wars were not so
fierce as those of former years, for the vices
of the Spaniards, especially a liking for brandy,
had fastened themselves upon many of them.
Since 1884, the date of the final agreement with
the Araucanians, they have become more widely
scattered, but those who live in the southern
provinces still follow the old habits and customs
of the early centuries. The people north
of the Bio-Bio River also had much Indian
blood in their veins by this time, and it is
unquestionably true that the Chilean soldiers
of to-day, who are considered brave,
owe very much of this valour to the Araucanians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with whom they have become intermixed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus35">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OX CARTS.</p>
</div>

<p>Many Araucanians may be seen in Temuco,
Osorno, Puerto Montt and other southern
towns. They come there to trade. Some are
on horseback, both men and women riding
astride, others come in clumsy ox-carts with
their wheat, corn or other produce. The
women wear bright-coloured blankets, which
are so fastened at the shoulders that the arms
are left bare. The skirts are belted at the
waist and fall about half way between the knee
and ankle, and they are generally barefooted
as well as bareheaded. Those who can afford
it wear immense silver earrings and breast
plates, and fasten their garments with silver
buckles. The men also wear blankets and a
<i>poncho</i>, which is a blanket with a hole in the
centre through which the head is thrust. Few
wear hats, but a red handkerchief or a band
around the head answers for a head covering.
Both sexes are fond of bright colours.</p>

<p>This race bears a very strong resemblance
to the North American Indians. They are
somewhat lighter in colour, but they have the
same high cheek-bones and straight black hair,
with little or no beard. Polygamy is common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
among them, and it is no rare thing to find
two or even three women in the home of an
Araucanian. They seem to get along fairly
well together, and each woman looks after her
own brood of children. Between them they
look after the master of the house and assist
him with his crops. The houses are generally
very simple structures, with low thatched
roofs, and one big door which can be closed up
with skins. The floor is usually the earth
beaten down hard and covered with sheep
skins. The cooking and other household utensils
are of the very crudest and simplest design.
Some of the Araucanians are very good
farmers, and have even progressed to the point
where they have adopted American ploughs and
reapers. Many work on the <i>haciendas</i> of the
rich Chileans, and they are said to make very
good hands. The government allotted lands to
these people with a condition that it can not
be sold, which was a very wise provision.
When an Araucanian acquires a liking for alcohol
he would trade his land, silver jewelry, his
wife or anything else of value in order to indulge
his appetite for drink. When sober they
are very clever traders, and usually manage
to secure full value for their goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The Araucanians have never adopted the religion
of the Spaniards as did the Aztecs and
Incas. It is true that there are some churches
among them, but the impress has not been very
great. They still believe in their old superstitions.
The men purchase their wives and then
go through the farce of stealing them. The
“medicine man,” who is oftentimes a woman,
is supposed to be able to ward off evil spirits
and troubles of all kinds. With these people
the evil spirits are believed to be at the bottom
of sickness, bad crops and all other woes. They
believe in a great father who watches over
them, and in a happy hunting ground somewhere
in the beyond to which all those departed
go.</p>

<p>One of the interesting characters met with
along the Pacific coast of South America is the
calaguayas, or the Indian doctor. One will
find him everywhere, from Panama to the
Araucanian country, carrying with him a pack
filled with dried herbs, cheap jewelry, handkerchiefs,
ribbons, mirrors and other notions,
which he sells to the people. He may be met
with on the trains, the coast steamers or any
other place, and generally carries with him
nothing but the suit he wears and a bright-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<i>poncho</i>, which is thrown over his
shoulders for additional warmth. He may be
seen sunning himself in the plaza of a town or
tramping over mountain trails. This man is
both a trader and tinker, and his sources of
livelihood are many indeed. He can mend a
clock, a tin pan, or a broken piece of crockery.
He can tell fortunes, interpret signs and omens,
or prepare love philters. He is a magician, and
can do all sorts of sleight-of-hand tricks. He
is a conjurer; he helps people who have been
bewitched, and altogether has a reputation for
superior wisdom, which he applies on all possible
occasions.</p>

<p>The chief business, however, of this unique
character is that of healing the sick, whether
man or beast, for he is equally successful as
a veterinary surgeon, or as a physician for the
human race; and it is really remarkable, as
many white people testify, the knowledge he
has of certain climatic ills to which the people
there are subject, and of herbs which will relieve
them. They claim to have herbs that will
cure everything to which humanity is subject.
It is a fact that there is no section of the globe
to-day where so many modern drugs come
from as the northern half of South America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and it is quite probable that these primitive
doctors first discovered the medicinal value of
many plants that are now common pharmaceutical
terms. Many stories are told among
miners and others, who have been obliged to
live in the interior, where regular physicians
were not obtainable, of climatic fevers and
other illnesses which have been cured by these
doctors.</p>

<p>“I have herbs that will cure everything,”
said the calaguayas to a doctor who doubted
his skill. As a proof he handed a leaf to the
doubter and asked him to smell it. As the man
did so his nose began to bleed, and he was
unable to stop it. After a time the calaguayas
handed him another leaf, and told him to smell
that. The hemorrhage immediately stopped.</p>

<p>The botanical knowledge which they possess,
for their medicines are all herbs, has been
handed down from generation to generation,
from the time of the ancient Incas. In fact
their origin is supposed to date from that ancient
race, when the medical men had an official
position at court and in the cities. As it was a
fixed law of the Incas that the son should follow
his father’s occupation, the knowledge of
the father in the use of herbs was passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
him to his son. The natives have much faith
in the skill of these doctors, so much so that
if one of them pronounces a man incurable, further
effort to relieve the afflicted person is generally
abandoned. In fact with some of the
tribes the sick are then exposed, in order to
hasten their death, so it is said.</p>

<p>There is also said to be a sort of free-masonry
among these doctors for mutual protection,
and they have built huts on some of the
lonesome trails, where the wandering medical
man can seek shelter and make himself as comfortable
as possible. In these rude shelters the
calaguayas is able to take shelter for himself,
if overtaken by storm, for he always carries
in his pack a little jerked beef, parched
corn, beans, and some cocoa leaves, the chewing
of which relieves hunger to some extent
and gives strength for prolonged exertion. In
these wild haunts they also collect in secret
their healing herbs, for they will never allow
any one to accompany them on such expeditions.
It is impossible to get one of them to
tell of what his herbs consist, as they preserve
the greatest secrecy concerning all of them.</p>

<p>The coming of the calaguayas is usually very
welcome to the communities that he visits, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
he knows everybody; and travelling from
one village to another he carries news and personal
messages, frequently, between friends.
He thus makes himself a travelling post-office
as well as a peripatetic newsmonger.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">EDUCATION AND THE ARTS</span></h2>

<p>Modern Chile owes little to the mother country
for its educational system. With the exception
of the establishment of a university
at Santiago, and one or two minor institutions,
Spain almost entirely neglected education in
this province. The wealthy classes sent their
children to Europe for their education, and the
poorer classes were given a little instruction by
the church. The Indians and peons were
taught the catechism and church doctrines in
a desultory way. With that all attempt at general
intellectual development was ended. It is
little wonder that only a small proportion of
the population were able to either read or write,
when the Spanish yoke was thrown off, or that
even to-day, when Chile has celebrated the centennial
of her declaration of independence, her
educational system will not compare favourably
with those found in the Anglo-Saxon and
Teutonic nations of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Education in Chile is absolutely free, though
not compulsory. Within the last few years the
Chilean government has given considerable attention
to public instruction, and has been
greatly extending the school system all over the
country. According to government reports
there were, in 1907, twenty-two hundred and
fifteen elementary schools, with forty-seven
hundred and twenty-nine teachers, and an attendance
of one hundred and seventy thousand
eight hundred and twenty-seven pupils. This
is only a small percentage of those of school
age, according to standards in the United
States. Besides these public schools there
were more than one hundred private schools
for elementary instruction, which were subsidized
by the government.</p>

<p>The school system is divided into primary,
elementary, secondary and the higher education.
The secondary education, which corresponds
to our high school, is provided in the
National Institute at Santiago, and at lyceums
located in various parts of the republic. One
of these lyceums is maintained in every province
in the republic, no matter how small, and
in every city or town of any importance.
In the same year, above cited, thirty-nine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
these institutions were for men and thirty for
women, having a total attendance of almost
twelve thousand. For the higher education
there is a national university at Santiago,
which is an old and well-equipped institution,
and fifteen normal schools located in various
parts of the republic. For technical instruction
there are a number of institutions located
in different parts of the republic, which are
conducted by various societies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus36">
<img src="images/illus36.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ESCUELA NAVAL, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>For instruction in agriculture schools are
maintained by the government at Concepción,
Santiago, Talca, San Fernando, Elqui and Salamanca.
These schools are all under the supervision
of the National Society of Agriculture,
and the government contributes liberally toward
their maintenance. There is also a school conducted
at Chillan for practical agricultural instruction.
A number of model farms are maintained
by the government, of which the principal
one is the Quinta Normal in the capital,
and a number of experimental institutions for
the cultivation of vines, trees, etc., are also supported
by the national government. The agricultural
schools, as well as those for the furtherance
of industries and mining, hold expositions
from time to time, in which, the products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the soil and factories are exhibited, as well
as the latest processes and appliances. To
these exhibitions the government contributes
liberally, in order to acquaint the public with
the latest scientific development. The societies
themselves are formed by a large number
of prominent Chileans, who devote considerable
time and energy to the development and improvement
of these industries.</p>

<p>Commercial schools have been established at
Iquique, Antofagasta, Valparaiso, Santiago,
Concepción, Vallenar, Coquimbo, Talca and
San Carlos. A number of industrial schools
are conducted under the direction of the society
for the improvement of industries, where
technical instruction is given to those preparing
them for such occupations as engineers,
electricians, architects, plumbers, masons, etc.
At Copiapó, Santiago and La Serena, the government
has established schools for the practical
instruction of mining engineers and mining
in general.</p>

<p>Military and naval education is given in ten
different academies, located in different parts
of the republic. One of the best of these is
the Escuela Naval at Valparaiso, which is situated
on a commanding location overlooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the lower town and bay. As the navy of Chile
commands great consideration this branch of
the educational system receives considerable
attention, and the cadets are put through a
very thorough course of instruction by able
instructors. The University of Santiago, as
well as a university under the supervision of
the Catholic Church, gives instruction in law,
political science, music, dentistry, civil engineering,
physics and mathematics. Then, in
addition, there is a National Conservatory of
Music, a School of Fine Arts, a National Observatory,
an Institute for the Deaf and Dumb,
and a School for the Blind.</p>

<p>A number of public libraries have been established
in various cities, at the head of which
is the National Library at Santiago, which contains
a valuable collection of books and manuscripts.
Next to this in importance is the public
library at Valparaiso. Several other cities
have followed the lead of these two and established
free public libraries. Museums of natural
history and also of arts are maintained in
Santiago.</p>

<p>The newspaper in Chile is as much of an
institution as it is in the United States. In the
cities of Valparaiso and Santiago one will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the newspapers equipped with an energetic
staff of reporters, who have, what Americans
would call, a good nose for news. Each one,
like his American counterpart, is trying to beat
his competitor, and acquire at least temporary
notoriety and fame.</p>

<p><i>El Mercurio</i> is the most noted newspaper of
the country, and publishes editions in Valparaiso,
Santiago and Concepción. It ranks with
<i>La Prensa</i>, in Buenos Aires, and the <i>Jornal do
Comercio</i>, in Rio de Janeiro. In the two
former cities <i>El Mercurio</i> owns fine buildings,
which are superior in their equipments to the
average newspaper office in the United States.
It has not only provided good quarters for its
editors, reporters, printers and other employees,
but has dining-rooms, private parlours,
baths, bedrooms, assembly-rooms, and other
features which American newspaper plants are
not equipped with. In these rooms entertainments
are given for the public, noted visitors
to that country are entertained, and many
other features of more or less public interest
are provided for the people. The owner of <i>El
Mercurio</i> is Mr. Augustin Edwards, who is a
member of a famous banking family of Santiago,
and has occupied various official positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in the country. <i>El Mercurio</i> was founded in
Valparaiso in 1827 and in Santiago in 1900. It
has long been one of the show things in Chile.
The editorials in the editions are the same, but
the news columns differ considerably because
of local interest.</p>

<p>One will find the editors of these papers as
well informed as the editors of the leading
newspapers in the United States, and their
information covers the whole world, perhaps
better than the average American editor. If
there is any distinguished foreigner visiting
the country the reporters eagerly interview
him, and the matter is displayed in headlines
which are quite similar to the land of yellow
journalism. In fact, in general make-up the
Chilean newspapers more nearly resemble
those of the United States than the journals
of any other country of South America. In
foreign news one will find two or three pages
of cable dispatches in <i>El Mercurio</i>, much more
than is printed in papers published by newspapers
in cities of similar size in the United
States. The <i>vida social</i> (society column) has
much news concerning <i>las distinguidas señoras
y señoritas</i>. Interspersed with accounts of
balls, parties, weddings, visitors, etc., will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
obituaries and notices of funerals. Echoes of
the get-rich-quick commercialism will be seen
in the advertising space, where columns of
advertisements of banks, nitrate companies and
promotion companies appear. Rates of exchange,
the movement of the stock market and
other items of commercial interest occupy a
prominent place. Sport is prominent, of which
football is an integral part, having been made
popular by the British residents. The entries
in the horse races, together with the various
riders and their weights, form a part of the
racing gossip, much as in English newspapers.
In fact these cosmopolitan publications provide
much interesting reading for all who can read
them.</p>

<p><i>Zig-Zag</i> of Santiago, and <i>Sucesos</i>, of Valparaiso,
are two illustrated weeklies, which are
really admirable and enterprising publications.
Each edition is practically a pictorial record
of the week both at home and abroad. There
will be photographs of those prominent in the
social and political life, pictured scenes of the
leading events of the week, cartoons and news
of the world depicted from the illustrated publications
of other countries. There is one English
newspaper published in Valparaiso. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
feature, which is always displayed in the Chilean
newspaper, is an editorial on the foremost
topic of the day. It is given the leading position,
every one reads it, and it is generally the
topic of conversation for the following day.
These editorials are generally well worth the
reading, for they not only display knowledge
but a catholicity of treatment that speaks well
for the Chilean.</p>

<p><i>La Union</i> also publishes editions in Santiago
and Valparaiso, and it is a well edited and well
conducted paper. Other newspapers of more
or less importance are <i>El Dia</i>, <i>La Lei</i>, <i>La Patria</i>,
<i>El Chileno</i>, <i>La Reforma</i>, <i>El Diario Popular</i>
and <i>Las Ultimas Noticias</i>, and others. In
all there are more than two hundred publications
of all kinds. Every one who can read at
all generally reads about all the newspapers,
so that even though the reading class is not
as large as with us, yet the circulation of these
newspapers is very creditable. Nevertheless
one wonders how they are all supported and
manage to survive.</p>

<p>Like all Spanish people the writers, though
not numerous, are usually voluminous. The
number is not great because of the lack of readers
and library privileges. One Spanish writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
says that the circle of readers in each Spanish-American
nation is in smaller numbers than in
a single street in London, a square in Paris,
or a district in Italy. Such a statement is not
true of Chile, for Santiago, Valparaiso and
Concepción have large numbers of educated
Chileans. But it is true that the writer has a
small circle as compared with the clientele of
an American, English or German author. Chilean
writers have been the most prolific of any
of the countries on the Pacific coast of South
America. The comparatively stable rule for
four decades was conducive to literary development.
The French influence in literature is
more noted than any other, and especially so
in literature of the lighter vein.</p>

<p>Before independence the chief subjects were
history, religion and poetry, and many of the
writers were ecclesiastics. Since the establishment
of the republic fiction, philosophy and
political economy have been prominent, and
lay writers have taken precedence over ecclesiastics.
Ramon Briceño and Venturo Marin are
two well known writers of modern philosophy
and ethics. Other Chilean writers along similar
lines were Errázuriz, Casanova, Aracena
Lopez, Arrasco, Albano and José Lara. Andres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Bello is a name that towers above all.
Says Professor Currier: “I regard him as
one of the most extraordinary men that the
Western Hemisphere has produced. Entirely
a self-made man, he explored almost every
field of human knowledge, and his numerous
works testify to his labours. Poet, philosopher,
linguist, philologist, litterateur, historian, educator
and jurist, such was Bello. His civil code
of Chile places him among the world’s legislators.
It is, perhaps, to be regretted that in
his earlier years his attention was so much
divided among various subjects that many of
his labours remain unfinished. Few countries
can boast of a man so versatile and of such
intellectual activity as Bello.”</p>

<p>Journalism in Chile, like the other Spanish-American
republics, is an important profession.
One of the greatest journalists Chile has
produced was Zorobabel Rodriguez, who exercised
immense influence on public thought for
many years. His editorials were the ordinary
topics at the breakfast table, and were looked
for by all parties from day to day. Rodriguez
was also a poet, novelist and all-round literary
man.</p>

<p>Chile has produced a number of historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
writers. Among these might be mentioned the
brothers Miguel Luis and Gregorio Victor
Amunategui, Manuel Bilbao, Vicuña Mackenna
and Diego Barrios Araña. Many have dropped
into poetry, for such a form of writing is popular
and natural with the Spanish race. The
drama is also an important branch of Spanish
literature and Chile has produced her fair
share of dramatists. The best known is probably
Carlos Walker Martinez, who succeeded
in touching a sympathetic and patriotic chord.
A number of novels have also been written by
Chilean writers, but they are unknown among
English readers.</p>

<p>The artistic is a strong element in the Latin
character. Foremost with the Italians, perhaps,
it also bears a vital relation to the Spaniard.
Any one who has visited any of the
Latin-American countries has not failed to observe
this trait, for art has been well preserved
in the New World, wherever either Spaniards
or Portuguese have held sway. In Chile this
art has not been tinged so much with Indian
influences as in Mexico. Here is found the
transplanted art of the Spaniard with very little
modification. There are many fine churches,
of which the cathedral of Santiago is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
noted example. It is a fine specimen of ecclesiastical
architecture. Hospitals and other public
buildings are built with an eye to the artistic.
Plazas are arranged with skill, and fine
statues abound all over the cities. Municipal
theatres have been built in several cities. The
Municipal Theatre of Santiago is a commodious
building and of artistic design. Although
it will not compare with the Colon Theatre of
Buenos Aires, or those in Rio de Janeiro or
Sao Paulo, Brazil, it is an artistic building.
Through the aid of a subsidy from the national
treasury operatic talent is brought from Europe
for at least a few weeks each season.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</span></h2>

<p>Peace as well as war has its heroes. In the
industrial development of Chile there are two
names of North Americans that deserve to
stand side by side with those of O’Higgins and
Cochrane, heroes of the war of independence.
In Valparaiso will be found a monument to the
memory of William Wheelwright, who had the
vision of a Franklin. Chance determined the
destiny of this remarkable man. Wrecked on
the shores of the Rio de la Plata, in 1823, the
youthful Wheelwright saw the needs of this
great continent, and he determined to devote
his energies towards the development of harbours
and transportation. He became a supercargo
on a vessel bound around Cape Horn,
and in this way reached Valparaiso. At first
he was looked upon as a dreamer. American
capitalists turned down his scheme, and even
the British did not welcome him at first.</p>

<p>“If that insane Wheelwright calls here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
again,” said an English consul to his servant,
“do not admit him.” Nothing daunted, however,
Wheelwright went to London and succeeded
in interesting some moneyed men in a
scheme for direct transportation between England
and the west coast. The first steamship
traversed the Straits of Magellan under this
concession and reached a Chilean port in 1840.
This was the beginning of the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company, which proved of inestimable
benefit in the upbuilding of Chile and
Peru. It was not many years until this company
was operating vessels as far as Panama.</p>

<p>The next vision of this master of industry
was the problem of conquering the Andes.
Could they be penetrated? Could the seemingly
insurmountable difficulties be overcome?
He planned a railroad from the port of Caldera
across the Andes. This port was opened
and the railroad constructed as far as Copiapó.
This scheme got no farther, but it was only the
beginning of colossal schemes. He planned
and built the railroad from Valparaiso toward
the capital as far as Llai Llai, but there it
stopped because of lack of funds. His struggles
with the opposition to this line read like
some of the contests in the English Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
over the first railroad projects. Wheelwright
then turned his attention to Argentina and
built the first railroad in that republic, a line
from Rosario to Cordoba, a distance of two
hundred and forty-six miles. His last public
work was a short railroad running from
Buenos Aires to Ensenada, in 1873. Although
he had further plans for public improvements
his health failed, and he sailed for London to
seek medical advice, where he died that same
year. His remains are buried at Newburyport,
Mass., the place of his birth, where they lie
amidst a long line of sturdy Puritan ancestors.</p>

<p>In Catskill, New York, a boy was born on the
7th of July, 1811. His name was Henry
Meiggs. His history reads like romance, for
he made and lost several fortunes both on the
Atlantic and the Pacific coasts. Elected as
treasurer of San Francisco County, California,
he loaned public money to friends who did not
pay it back. He then fled as a defaulter to
South America. He first landed in Chile. The
uncompleted railroad to the capital, that had
been begun by Wheelwright, first engaged the
mental activities of this remarkable man. For
a decade the government had been planning to
extend this railroad “to-morrow.” Meiggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
negotiated with the government and finally
secured the contract. With characteristic Yankee
ingenuity he succeeded in getting a clause
inserted giving a premium for each section
completed within a specified time. He succeeded
in building each section in the shortest
period and collected the maximum premium.
The result was that Meiggs realized a profit of
more than a million dollars, and made a great
reputation for himself. Since that time the
Chilean government is very chary about such
bonuses.</p>

<p>Meiggs married a Chilean woman and built
a magnificent residence in Santiago. But his
later enterprises were in Peru. He built the
railroad from Mollendo to Arequipa. His
greatest undertaking, however, was the famous
Oroya Railroad over the Andes, the highest
railroad in the world and one of its wonders.
Great gorges were surmounted, rushing streams
spanned with bridges where such work seemed
impossible, tunnels bored where men had to
hang over precipices by means of ropes to
secure a start and other obstacles of nature
were overcome. Before the completion of the
road Meiggs was compelled to use his own private
fortune. But he accomplished the task.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
One hears many tales of this eccentric man in
Chile and Peru. It stands to his credit that,
although he lived in luxury and spent money
lavishly, he paid all his debts back in the land
of his birth in order to stand before the world
as an honest man.</p>

<p>The problem of connecting the widely separated
sections of Chile with easy and convenient
means of transportation has been and
is a serious one. It was but natural, owing to
the long extent of coast line, that the first attention
of the Chilean government was given
to ocean navigation. Furthermore, the Chileans
have proven to be good navigators, and
the record of their steamships has been very
good. There has been the further advantage
in developing this means of transportation in
the fact that no part of Chile is very far distant
from the Pacific coast. This has developed
a large number of short railways, which
run from the ports to the mineral or agricultural
districts of the interior. There are in all
sixteen ports open to international commerce,
and forty-four inferior ports which are used
in the coast trade. The different character of
the northern, central and southern sections
has created a demand for exchange of products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
between those sections, which has made the
coast trade of great importance.</p>

<p>The ports of Chile were opened to the commerce
of all the world as soon as the independent
government was fully organized. It is a
historic fact that among the first vessels that
arrived in Chile, after independence had been
achieved, was a frigate from New York, which
brought one of the first printing presses to
South America and also some American printers,
who established the first Chilean periodical.
At first Valparaiso claimed nearly all of
the tonnage, because of its nearness to the capital.
At that time, also, the Chilean seacoast
was not more than half as long as it is at the
present time. Vessels soon began to operate
under the Chilean flag, although most of the
first vessels were owned by foreign capital. As
early as 1834 there were no less than one hundred
and thirty-four national vessels, principally
engaged in the coast trade. When William
Wheelwright organized the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company a new era in Chilean
prosperity was begun. Two vessels, the <i>Chile</i>
and <i>Peru</i>, both of them small boats, constituted
the beginning of the fleet which finally developed
into the great company, which for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
years plied between the west coast and Europe.
It has recently been absorbed by another English
company, the Royal Mail Steam Packet
Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus37">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE HARBOUR, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>This English company, as well as other companies,
were subsidized by the Chilean government,
in order to get better coast service between
the various ports. This service was
eventually extended to the city of Panama. In
1870 the most powerful Chilean company was
organized under the name of the Compañia
Sul Americana de Vapores, which soon became
a very active competitor of the English company.
The number of its vessels was continually
added to, most of them being built by
English shipbuilders, until to-day this company
has more than twenty boats. Many of
these are very comfortable steamers, of considerable
capacity, and operate all the way between
Puerto Montt and Panama. In addition
to this company, there are a number of small
companies, owned by Chilean capital, and other
steamers belonging to private individuals, or
business houses which carry on a coast trade
more or less extensive. The Chilean company
and the English company, which for a long
time were active rivals, have at last entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
into an operating agreement. By the terms of
this agreement the government subsidy is
shared, and the two companies operate an alternating
service between Valparaiso and Panama.
The laws of Chile governing maritime
transportation are very liberal, and the fees
levied at the various ports are exceedingly reasonable.
It has been recognized by Chile that
the development of commercial relations with
the various countries of America depends, to
a great extent, upon the existence of regular
and rapid lines of navigation which will transport
products at reasonable rates.</p>

<p>The government has spent a great deal of
money in recent years in dredging the channels,
placing buoys at the dangerous points and
erecting lighthouses along the coast, until to-day
there are more than fifty lighthouses which
are regularly maintained by Chile.</p>

<p>What will eventually prove to be the backbone
of the Chilean railway system is termed
the Longitudinal Railway, work upon which is
being prosecuted actively by the government at
various places. When completed it is planned
to have a continuous railway from Tacna, in
the north, to Puerto Montt, at the south, a distance
of almost two thousand miles. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
been found that wherever the railroad has been
extended, development has followed. This has
been especially true of the great central valley
through which rails have been laid as far as
Osorno, only seventy-eight miles from Puerto
Montt. This line has been constructed entirely
by the government. It is built of standard
gauge width, and also upon the same gauge for
some distance north of Santiago. Through the
north central part of Chile the government
roads have all been built upon the narrow
gauge plan, one metre in width, because the
occasional transverse spurs of the Andes,
which run toward the coast, have made construction
more difficult, and it has been easier
to make the necessary curves by using that
gauge, so that the line could be built as inexpensive
as possible. At the present time nearly
all of the energies of the government are being
applied to the completion of this great project,
which has already cost it many millions of
dollars.</p>

<p>A little more than one-half of the railway
mileage in Chile has been built and is owned
by the government itself. It has not been a
profitable enterprise, for it costs about ninety-five
per cent. of the gross income for operating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
expenses and maintenance. One reason for
this, of course, is that the government lines,
many of them, have been built through thinly-settled
territory, and where traffic up to the
present time has been very light. Then, again,
the charges upon these state railways are entirely
too small, for nowhere can one travel so
cheaply as upon the government railways of
Chile. Then there is also the problem which a
government must always face, in operating
a public utility enterprise, that the officials,
whose duty it is to look after the work, do not
apply to it the same careful attention to detail,
do not get as much work out of their employees
as a private corporation, and are likely to take
a chance at some form of graft when the
opportunity affords. The question has been
seriously considered by the government of placing
the operation of the principal lines in the
hands of a private company; in fact, one company
has made a proposition to operate the road
between Santiago and Valparaiso, and take for
its profit simply what it can save in the cost
of operation over the present cost.</p>

<p>In the northern provinces there are a number
of railways operating from the coast up a
greater or lesser distance inland. The oldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
railway in the republic, as well as in South
America, runs from Caldera to Copiapó. As
heretofore mentioned, this great undertaking
was due to William Wheelwright. It was his
plan to continue this railway over the Andes,
and it is said by engineers to present fewer
difficulties than the one finally chosen, which
was partly on sentimental grounds. It is quite
possible that the dream of the American captain
of industry may some day come true as development
continues. It was never extended
further than the first terminus, over which the
first locomotive was run in 1851. The first locomotive
exported from the United States was
used on this railroad. A number of short
branches have now been built connecting with
this main line, but rail connection with the
Federal capital is still a thing of “to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The most northern railway runs from the
port of Arica to Tacna, and is only about forty
miles in length. From Arica an international
railroad is being built across the Andes into
Bolivia, in accordance with a treaty entered into
between the two countries. It will not pass
through Tacna, as an independent route has
been selected which promised fewer difficulties.
It is only about one hundred and forty miles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the Bolivian frontier by this route, and only a
little greater distance from there to La Paz.
This will make the shortest and most direct
route to the Bolivian capital. The contract has
been let for the entire work, but it is proceeding
very slowly.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the coast the next railway
centre is in the nitrate district, where a number
of short railways connect Iquique, Pisagua,
Tocapilla, Caleta Buena and other towns in that
district, making up a total of nearly four
hundred miles. Antofagasta also has some
short spurs which run back into the mineral
regions, and carry the ore down to that port.
The principal line at this place, however,
is the international railway which runs from
Antofagasta to the Bolivian city of Oruro, and
there connects with a Bolivian railway which
runs to the capital, La Paz. This railway is
constructed upon an extremely narrow gauge
of thirty inches. The Chilean section of the
railway ends at Ollague, a distance of two
hundred and seventy-five miles. This railway
was originally built to aid in developing some
of the rich mines in Potosi, Bolivia. By the aid
of a government subsidy, it was finally completed
in 1892. This is the largest private railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
enterprise in Chile. It would be difficult
to imagine a more dreary route over which a
railway could be planned than the Chilean
section of this railway. At first the question of
a water supply for the engines was a serious
problem, as the water which they were able to
secure easily was so permeated with minerals
that it destroyed the boilers. The concession
of supplying the city of Antofagasta with
water was finally conceded to the railway
company, and, with that monopoly as an
aid, pipes were laid for a distance of more
than two hundred miles to supply the water
tanks of the railway and the city of
Antofagasta. The freight hauled over this road
is quite considerable, since it is one of the two
lines which at present reach from the coast to
the republic of Bolivia. Half or more of the
freight, to and from that inland republic, is
shipped by this route, in addition to the product
of the mines of the famous Huanchaca Company.</p>

<p>In the province of Coquimbo there are several
short sections of railroad, all of which were
constructed by the government. In all these
lines total about two hundred miles. It will not
be long until Coquimbo will be connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the main line by a longitudinal railway. In
the northern section of the country there are
no less than fourteen different lines, and at
least three different gauges of track.</p>

<p>The railways of the central valley from
Santiago south form the most extensive system
in the republic. All of these railways, with the
exception of a very few branches, belong to the
state, and they form a single system which
unites the principal sections of population
throughout that section. The main track follows
the longitudinal valley from north to south in
a line which keeps to the same general direction
until it ends at Osorno. In its course this system
crosses no less than a dozen of the provinces
of Chile. Construction has been fairly
difficult, and the expense of bridges has been
unusually high. There are many long and high
bridges, such as those across the Maule, Maipo,
Mallico, Laja and Bio-Bio rivers. Most of them
have been of French construction. From
Santiago to Llanquihue, there are a number of
cross railways which run from this main line
to the ports, and also some that run inland
toward the Andes for a short distance. These
were built by the government in its efforts to
open up the unpopulated sections. In the carboniferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
zone around the Bay of Arauco there
are a number of branches which connect the
mines, the mining towns and the ports. It will
not be long until the railway will be extended
to Puerto Montt, which will complete the
present plans of the government for southern
extension.</p>

<p>There are no less than half a dozen transandine
railways which have been planned, and
for which concessions have been granted by the
government of Chile. Two have been completed,
two more have had actual work done
in the way of construction and the other two
are still visionary. One project, which bodes
very fair to reach completion, is a railroad that
will have for its terminal points the Chilean
port of Talcahuano and Bahia Blanca, Argentina.
It will run through Monte Aguila and
Cholguan, and cross the Andes at Lake Laja.
There it will connect with the Great Southern
Railway of Argentina, which has already been
built from Bahia Blanca to Neuquen, and which
is now being extended from there to Chos
Malal. The Andes at this point are not nearly
so high as farther north, so that fewer difficulties
will be encountered in the construction
than on those transandine railways which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
already been built. It will necessitate a tunnel
about one mile in length only to pass the summit.
Engineers who have surveyed this route
report it as very feasible and strongly recommend
it. It is several hundred miles south of
both Valparaiso and Buenos Aires, passes
through an extremely rich agricultural country
and ought to be constructed before many years.
It will be of distinct advantage to both republics.</p>

<p>Interest in railroad construction in Chile in
recent years has centred in the transandine
railway via Juncal and Uspallata pass, the
historic route by which General San Martin
led his conquering legions into that country.
Its completion in the spring of 1910 was a
significant event, which was duly celebrated
by both Chile and Argentina. Just a half
century had passed since Wheelwright first
suggested to English capitalists the feasibility
of a railroad across the Andes to connect the
Atlantic with the Pacific, when the first train
passed through the two mile tunnel that pierced
the international barrier of rock at this point.
Trains are now running regularly, and the
interruption caused by the winter snows is at
an end. This is the first line to connect the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
oceans, and, to the South Americans, it was
as great an event as the opening of the first
transcontinental railroad in the United States.
The distance from Valparaiso to Buenos Aires
is eight hundred and eighty-eight miles, and
the trip is made in thirty-eight hours. It is
hoped by the officials, however, to reduce the
running time to twenty-nine hours in the course
of time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus38">
<img src="images/illus38.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">JUNCAL STATION.</p>
</div>

<p>The first practical steps in this undertaking
were made by two English-Chilean engineers,
John and Matthew Clark. They obtained the
necessary concession from Argentina in 1872,
and from Chile two years later. The Chilean
government guaranteed seven per cent. on a
capital of three millions of dollars. But this
concession was unsatisfactory. In 1889 the
actual work of construction was begun, but it
was stopped after less than twenty miles had
been completed. The old concession having
lapsed a new one was granted in 1903 to the
Transandine Construction company on a five
per cent. guarantee for twenty years. In 1906
the road was opened to Juncal, and in 1909 to
Caracoles, the mouth of the Chilean end of the
tunnel. The entire distance from Los Andes to
the tunnel is forty-eight miles. In that distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the altitude rises almost eight thousand feet.
The grade in places reaches eight per cent.
There are several miles of the Abt system of
cogs. Tunnels and bridges are numerous, and
a number of avalanche sheds have been built.
The Chilean slopes of the Andes are much more
abrupt than those on the Argentina side, and
the work of construction has been correspondingly
more difficult. It provides a grand
scenic route for the jaded continental traveller
that furnishes scenery as grandly picturesque
as anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>One unfortunate feature is the differing
width of track. It will be necessary to reload
freight three times in the journey across the
continent. From Valparaiso to Los Andes the
gauge is standard. Between Los Andes and
Mendoza it is one metre, and from Mendoza to
Buenos Aires it is five feet eight inches. This
may possibly be changed in the future, but it
will be many years. In the meantime much
trouble and extra work will be necessitated in
freight traffic. To the passenger it means only
a little annoyance, but not much delay.</p>

<span class="smaller">RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES</span></h2>

<p>In order to fully understand the anomalous
position occupied by Church and State in the
Spanish-American republics, it will be well to
go back several centuries and study for a
moment the development of the clerical policy
of Spain, and its relations with the Church of
Rome. With the discovery of the New World,
the Church was placed in a position where it
felt called upon to do something which it was
next to impossible to undertake independently.
It felt the responsibility of evangelizing the
heathen in the newly-discovered countries, and
yet it appreciated its inability to assume this
burden, because it had not the means to
propagate religion amongst a hostile people,
which could only be advanced efficiently by
means of a costly expedition. Hence it was necessary
for the Holy See to proceed to convert
the inhabitants of the New World through
ecclesiastics, or other persons who followed the
invading forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>In compliance with this view the Pope issued
the famous bull of Alexander VI, in 1493,
which is in part as follows: “We give, concede
and assign them (lands in the New World)
in perpetuity to you and the Kings of Castile
and of Leon, your heirs and successors: and
we make, constitute and depute you and your
heirs and successors, the aforesaid, lords of
these lands, with free, full and absolute power,
authority and jurisdiction.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This absolute
power granted to Spain was not used against
the Church, as subsequent events showed, for
the priests and monks everywhere accompanied
the soldiers, and conquests of the civil power
were invariably attended with at least the
nominal conversion of the natives to Christianity.
This alliance placed in the absolute power
of the king of Spain the privilege to name the
priests, or other ecclesiastics, who might accompany
the expeditions, and gave him absolute
power over their work. All causes of friction
between bishops, priests and other dignitaries
were decided alone by the sovereign or his
representatives in the New World, although it
might be regarded entirely as a spiritual matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Under the interpretation given to this papal
authority, the King of Spain had it within his
power to define the boundaries of the archbishoprics
and bishoprics, and the Church was
even compelled to secure his consent for the
erection of vicarages, churches, monasteries,
convents and other places for religious worship.</p>

<p>One decree of the King of Spain, which is
similar to many others, reads as follows: “We
wish and command that there shall not be
created, instituted, founded or conceded any
cathedral or parochial church, monastery, hospital,
votive church, or any other pious or
religious place without our express command,
or that of the person who shall have our authority
of commission for this purpose.” And
again, “That there shall not be instituted or
established any archbishopric, dignitary, canonry,
prebend, benefice, curacy, or any other
benefice or ecclesiastical or religious office without
our consent or presentation.” At another
time it was decreed: “If in effect, or by dissimulation,
any person shall make or begin to
make any of these edifices without this prerequisite
the viceroys, audiencas or governors
shall cause them to be demolished, and everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
reduced to its previous state without
cause or delay.” For the erection of the
cathedral churches the royal treasury contributed
one-third.</p>

<p>These privileges were at first jealously
guarded by the royal authorities. In maintaining
the right of patronage the civil courts were
given jurisdiction instead of the ecclesiastical
courts, which likewise gave the civil authorities
an advantage. There was in each bishopric,
however, an ecclesiastical court over whose
decision appeal might be made to the archbishop.
The cases which might be brought before
this court were those which concerned
tithes, patronages, marriages, legitimation, funerals,
donations to churches and such other
pious matters. If a case arose in which a layman
brought action against a priest, this was
tried before an ecclesiastical church, but, if a
priest brought action against a layman, the
cause was tried before a secular tribunal. The
Church likewise had a general council, which
was composed of a number of archbishops,
cardinals and other high church officials. It
was the general aim of the Church to have the
ecclesiastical division correspond with the civil
divisions of the territory, thus making the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
political capitals also the seats of religious
authorities, although there were exceptions to
this rule. One of these was in Chile, where,
although the captaincy-general of Chile was independent
of the vice-royalty of Peru, yet the
Bishop of Santiago was subservient to the
Archbishop of Lima. Thus at every step
in the administration of ecclesiastical affairs in
America, the authority and domination of the
civil power was recognized. In the first century
of the colonial period the Archbishop of
Lima was the metropolitan for all of South
America under Spanish rule, but this was later
divided.</p>

<p>Wherever the Spaniards established themselves
in America, they made the natives serfs,
and forced them to approximately unrequited
labour. Looking upon these natives as an inferior
race, it soon became unpopular among
the Spaniards to perform any labour which
might be considered menial. This made the
opportunities for profitable employment comparatively
scarce. The doors of the monasteries
were always open, however, and the life
within the cloisters, although seemingly one of
self abnegation and denial, in reality offered
opportunities for intellectual development, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
vague contemplation and day dreaming, and
also a chance to enjoy more of the things of
the world than fell to the lot of the average
man outside of the cloistered walls. Furthermore,
the fact that the ecclesiastical offices were
at the disposal of the representatives of the
Crown gave opportunities to those persons to
favour friends who wore the cloak of the
Church, which they could not do if the same
persons were following secular pursuits, because
of the limited number of positions at their
disposal in civil life. Hence it was that the
ranks of the ecclesiastics came to be recruited
not so much from those who were religiously
inclined, as from those who sought ease, indulgence
in the appetites and passions, and
were ambitious for power and authority.</p>

<p>A century after the beginning of Spanish
rule, the missionaries on the frontier had lost
their enthusiasm to make converts, and thereafter
assisted in advancing the civilization of
the natives very little. The cupidity of those
priests, who were not noted for their piety, was
excited by the opportunities which their position
gave them. There were numerous opportunities
to charge fees and perquisites for the
services required of them, and they took full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
advantage of it. Furthermore, they sold to
the Indians various articles, such as rosaries
and images, at an enormous profit, and persuaded
them to labour upon their buildings and
in their little settlements without compensation
other than a bare living. Likewise many persons
who had acquired great wealth in the New
World, but had probably lived reckless and
immoral lives, when nearing the end of
life were anxious to secure absolution for their
sins, and as short an experience as possible in
the purgatory of the next world. The representatives
of the Church urged upon them the
necessity of giving all of their worldly goods
into its keeping, in return for the desired absolution.
The mysticism with which the Church
surrounded itself was favourable to the securing
of such a boon, and the monastic and convent
orders accordingly accumulated great
wealth.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the power of the Church
in the later period of colonial rule was greatly
increased through the accumulation of wealth,
and through the access to its ranks of men
who were influenced by political and covetous,
rather than pious principles. After a century
or more from the beginning of Spanish rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the church dignitaries were able to a great extent
to defy the civil authorities. As a natural
consequence, the civil authorities then sought
the aid and influence of the ecclesiastics. The
evil effects of these various influences upon the
Church can be traced down even to the present
time in Chile, as well as the other countries
in South America. Most of the political
troubles have been the result of friction between
the conservatives, who were aided by
the Church, and the liberals, who were intent
upon restricting the power of that body.</p>

</div>

<p>The wealth of the Catholic Church in Chile
is still enormous, even after a considerable
portion of it has been taken by the government
for public uses. Many of the public school
and college buildings were formerly the property
of the Jesuit or other monastic order. It
is said that the church property in Santiago
alone is worth not less than one hundred
million dollars in gold. It owns some of the
best business blocks, as well as hundreds of
houses, and great <i>haciendas</i> upon which wine
is manufactured and other products raised.
A great part of this wealth is owned by the
various orders established in the country. The
Carmelite nuns of Santiago are a very wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
organization and possess an enormous income.
These nuns never allow their faces to be seen
by men. The monastic order, known as the
Dominican Friars, is also a very wealthy body.
They dress in black hats and gowns, with
white flannel undergowns which reach clear to
the feet. This gives them quite a strange
appearance to one not familiar with the sight
of such costumes worn by religious orders.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church of the west coast of
South America is less liberal than on the east
coast. The reason for this condition, probably,
is that it has been less influenced by outside
causes, because of the comparative isolation
of the countries and remoteness from Europe.
One will find still less liberality as you proceed
along the west coast from Chile northward.
In Chile, there is an element of tolerance
towards other forms of worship, at least on
the part of the officials. Protestant churches
exist in nearly all of the towns of any size, and
quite a number of mission workers are busily
engaged in spreading their doctrines. In Peru,
a few Protestant congregations exist. They
are not allowed to own churches, and their
congregations are gathered together by printed
invitations, which is simply a means of evading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the letter of the law that is permitted by the
authorities. In Ecuador, although the government
attempts to observe religious tolerance,
yet the power of the priesthood is so strong
that Protestant workers outside of Quito and
Guayaquil are oftentimes exposed to danger
of violence.</p>

<p>“The religion of the republic of Chile is
the Roman Apostolic Catholic to the exclusion
of any other.” These are the words of the
Constitution of Chile, which thus gives to the
Roman Catholic Church the protection and
support of the government. Nevertheless
religious freedom prevails for, by an act of
July 27, 1865, it was established that those who
do not profess the Roman Catholic religion
are allowed to worship within the enclosure
of private buildings, and are permitted to
establish and maintain schools in the doctrine
of their respective faiths. From a religious
standpoint the republic is divided into one
archbishopric, three bishoprics and two vicarages.
The cathedral at Santiago is the church
of the archbishop, and a magnificent residence
for his use stands alongside of the church.
The bishoprics are known as Serena, Concepción
and Ancud. Two ecclesiastical vicarages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
have been established at Antofagasta and
Tarapacá.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in Chile, however, is
as different from the same church in the United
States as it is possible for two branches of
the same general head to be. There is no spirit
of liberality, and no general purpose to recognize
religious freedom except as it is compelled
by law. The influx of foreigners has naturally
modified things to some extent, because many
of those coming in have been members of
Protestant denominations, but the old condition
of affairs has not yet been entirely eradicated.</p>

<p>It is the women who support the Church,
and they are intense devotees of its worship.
The men are generally absolutely indifferent
to religion in any form. As a prominent
Chilean gentleman told me, “we leave the
women attend to the religious duties.” This
statement seemed to be borne out by the facts,
as a number of visits to different churches at
the hour of mass showed that not one out of
perhaps fifteen or twenty present were men.
The others were entirely women, girls and
small children. The power of the priesthood
over the women is very strong, and it is in
this way that they exert whatever influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
they have, as the women will blindly do anything
that the priests advise them to do.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs would be less
reprehensible, if every member of the priesthood
was an intelligent and proper person. It
is an unfortunate fact, however, that many
members of the priesthood come from the lower
strata of society, rather than from the higher.
They are persons of low intelligence, rather
than men of high attainments. To this class
of priests is due many of the strange practices
which one will find in the churches, or see done
in the name of the Church in the remote districts.
Some of the processions are so grotesque
that they seem almost ridiculous, and
certainly would not have the direct approval
of the Pontiff. As one of the priests said:
“The ignorant people of these regions are fond
of demonstrations in which they can participate,
and it does them more good to carry a
banner and walk in a procession than you can
imagine. If the Church does not provide such
amusements, the politicians will do so, and it
is very important that we keep our people
under our own control.” It is upon this theory,
that the ignorant natives demand these public
processions, that they are permitted to exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
But the fact that they also provide a considerable
source of revenue probably has
something to do with their continuation as
well.</p>

<p>In the city of Santiago a festival is held each
year, which is a fair illustration of the origin
of many of these local celebrations. On the
fifth of May, 1848, there occurred in that city
a most disastrous earthquake. It was learned
that a woman in that city, who had been disgusted
with the refusal of her particular saint
to answer her prayers, tore the image from the
altar, and, stripping it of its decorations,
threw it into the street. At that very moment
the earthquake began. As it happened, however,
a priest who was hurrying away from
danger saw the image, picked it up and carried
it into a neighbouring church, where it was
reverently placed upon an altar. At that very
moment the earthquake ceased, and so from
that time to this the fifth of May is a holiday,
which is second in importance only to Independence
Day. It used to be that this image
was taken from the altar on these occasions,
carried through the streets under a scarlet
canopy, and was followed by a procession which
included the president of the republic, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
cabinet, members of congress, justices, archbishop,
bishop and all of the other prelates
of the Church and thousands of people with
bands of music and regiments of soldiers.
This saint became known as Saint Cinco de
Mayo (Saint Fifth of May), because the woman
who threw it into the street and her family
were killed in the earthquake, and it was impossible
to ascertain what particular saint it
was originally intended to represent. In recent
years, however, this celebration has lost
much of its importance, although the Church
still recognizes it as a regular holiday in its
calendar.</p>

<p>The high fees charged for the services of
the Church have been much criticized, and deservedly
so. In most places not a single service
will be performed without the payment of the
fee in advance. This is specially to be condemned
in the case of the fees that are charged
for marriages. Although a marriage to be
legal in Chile must have a civil ceremony, for
which only a small charge is made, yet those
who are devoted to the Church consider the
religious ceremony the essential one. As the
priests will not perform this ceremony without
the regular fee being paid, which amounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to several dollars, and the contracting parties
do not consider the civil ceremony as of any
value, because they are so instructed by the
priesthood, the result is that neither ceremony
is performed, and an injustice is done to all
parties concerned. Even in the higher circles
great confusion sometimes arises where the
man, for instance, considers the civil ceremony
necessary, and the woman, under the advice
of her counsellor, is not willing to have it performed.
The result has been considerable confusion,
and also has made the Church and civil
authorities unnecessarily opposed to each other
in many instances.</p>

<p>Many claim that South America is not a
legitimate field for Protestant missionary work.
Their theory is that the country was at one
time evangelized by missionaries, and therefore
should not be touched by other missionary
effort. The fact is that religious conditions in
South America savour much of the darkness of
the Middle Ages. There is to-day an unbelief
and utter indifference to spiritual things among
the men, which is hard to realize until one has
had actual contact with it. Whatever effort
can better these conditions, and thereby improve
the morals of the people, should be encouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
The Roman Catholics pursue their
efforts among the strongest Protestant countries,
and they should not be criticized for so
doing. If they can reach a class or element
that has not been touched by Protestant effort,
they are thereby doing good for that nation
and the world in general. True religion and
true Christianity should be recognized and encouraged
under whatever name it may be
found. It would be far better if the Catholic
Church in Chile, and other South American
countries, would welcome the Protestant ministers,
and join hands with them in their efforts
to raise the standards of living among the
people.</p>

<p>One will find signs of the Protestant invasion
of Chile from Arica, in the extreme north, to
Tierra del Fuego. The movement has generally
been accompanied by educational enterprise,
of which there are several splendid
examples in Chile. One of these is the
American College for Girls, and the Instituto
Ingles, an institution for boys, both of which
are in Santiago. The former, which is under
the control and direction of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, has achieved more than a
national reputation in Chile, and many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
very best families send their girls to that college
for their education. It is recognized as
giving the very best education that can be obtained
in the Republic, and the enrollment has
included the names of the children of presidents
of the republic, and many others in high
authority. The same may be said of the latter
institution, which is under the control of the
American Presbyterian Church, and which is
always crowded to its utmost capacity, with
many names upon the waiting list who cannot
be accommodated. The patrons of the two
institutions understand that the schools are
Protestant schools, that the Bible is read and
studied, that morning prayers are compulsory,
but beyond that the students are at liberty to
attend any religious services that may be
desired by the parents. Outside of the regular
religious services, no effort is made to alienate
the students from the church in which they
have been baptized. The Methodists also conduct
grammar schools at Concepción and
Iquique, and schools of the primary and lower
grammar grades at other places. In all more
than fifty day schools are conducted by these
two denominations. The work that has been
begun is a beneficial one in a moral way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the results have been very satisfactory to those
engaged in the work.</p>

<p>At the present time the American Presbyterian
and the Methodist Episcopal Churches
are the only American denominations that are
aggressively doing missionary work in Chile.
The former began their work in 1873, and the
latter in 1878. The Methodists have thirty
missionaries and a large number of native
workers assisting them, and have established
fifty-eight stations. The Presbyterians have
twenty-six missionaries, and these workers,
together with native helpers, are at work in
sixty-five different communities. Both in
Valparaiso and Santiago there is a Union
Church, to which members of various Protestant
bodies come for the religious services,
and both of these churches are doing a very
effective work.</p>

<p>The Protestant Anglican Church was the
first to begin any evangelistic work in Chile.
Its first mission was established more than
sixty years ago. They began work in the extreme
south, and still have stations on Tierra
del Fuego for the Indians. They also have
churches at Santiago, Valparaiso, Iquique,
Concepción and Punta Arenas for the English-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
people who live in those cities.</p>

<p>The American and British Bible Societies
have aggressively spread over the country. The
colporteurs of these societies have gone up and
down over the country, by train and coach, on
foot and mule-back, with copies of the Scriptures
in various languages. These books are
sold for a very small sum, and, if the person
is too poor to buy, they are freely given. The
work has not always been easy or pleasant,
for such deep prejudice is oftentimes encountered
that insults and little indignities have
followed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE</span></h2>

<p>The subjugation and colonization of Chile
was due to two causes. Pedro de Valdivia,
who had distinguished himself in Peru, wanted
an empire for himself, and Francisco Pizarro
was desirous of ridding himself of so formidable
a rival. Valdivia was therefore graciously
permitted to march into and conquer at his
own expense the country south of Peru. After
many months of preparation Valdivia set out
on his expedition with one hundred and fifty
Spaniards, provided with horses and arms,
one thousand Indians, mostly carriers, and a
supply of cattle, pigs, poultry and seeds of
many European plants. Thus equipped this
cavalier set out from Lima, and marched across
the deserts of Arequipa, Tacna, Tarapacá and
Atacama. He reached the central valley of
Chile without the loss of a single Spaniard
through sickness or desertion—a remarkable
record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The first few years were hard ones for these
colonists. Santiago was founded and made the
capitol. The Indians were hostile, and dissensions
soon arose among Valdivia’s followers.
Several small parties of reinforcements
arrived, but the Spaniards’ position
was always precarious because of the fierce
Araucanians. After Valdivia’s death in 1551,
misfortune followed misfortune in the new
colony. Garcia Hurlado de Mendoza, one of
the viceroys of Peru, succeeded him as governor.
This man was a mere youth with no
experience, and his rule was fraught with
disaster. He established churches and monastic
orders, provided magnificent shows and spectacles,
but did not materially improve the condition
of the colony. Then came Francisco and
Pedro de Villagran and a number of other
governors,—some good and more of them bad.
The colony slowly increased in numbers, but
constant war with the Indians prevented it from
growing rapidly. The coast was swept several
times by Dutch and English pirates. Earthquakes
and plagues reaped their harvests from
the inhabitants. But wealth was increasing.
Thus passed the sixteenth, seventeenth and
part of the eighteenth centuries. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
be impossible within the limits of this volume
to detail all events, but some of the Indian
wars are mentioned in another chapter.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
usual narrow-sighted policy of Spain toward
all her dependencies was followed, and the local
disaffection grew more acute each year.</p>

<p>It was Voltaire who said that “cruelty leads
to independence.” The colonial system of
Spain in South and Central America, of which
the writer has had occasion to treat before,
was one of selfishness, cruelty and tyranny.
Only the merchants of Cadiz were allowed to
sell goods to the colonists, and the colonists
were permitted to sell their products only to
the same traders, who managed to reap a profit,
owing to the monopoly granted them, of as
much as three hundred per cent. Local human
rights were not recognized by the government
of Spain. It was treason for a man to assert
his freedom, or to seek a free field for his
labour. The natives were compelled to labour
for the conquerors without profit. Imposing
buildings were constructed, cities were encircled
with massive walls, great monasteries,
churches, and convents rose on the hills, all
by the unrequited toil of generations of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
impressed natives. Education was denied, and
the local government, including the church
officials, united in this system of repression
and disregard of human rights.</p>

<p>There was, however, another element which
entered into final independence. For this we
must hark back to Spain for a moment. Charles
IV had resigned his throne in favour of his
son, Ferdinand VII. The colonists accepted
this change because of their loyalty to the
heredity in line of succession, which had to
them a religious as well as political significance.
Charles IV afterwards regretted his abdication
and appealed to Napoleon, who was then
in the height of his power, alleging that the
abdication had not been voluntary. Napoleon
poured troops into Spain, and it was not long
until Ferdinand VII was compelled to yield.
Napoleon then placed his favourite brother,
Joseph, upon the throne of Spain. Joseph was
a well-meaning monarch, a man of far more
principle than his brother, who, perhaps, would
have done well by the colonists, had he been
permitted to work out their destinies. The
colonists, however, felt no loyalty toward him,
and would not recognize his authority. When
Ferdinand VII was finally restored to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
throne after the downfall of Napoleon, he became
a tyrant, and violently opposed all
liberal ideas. The despotism that Napoleon
had overthrown was reestablished. These mistaken
moves on the part of Ferdinand, a period
of a few years during which the Crown had
been opposed, and the free air of America all
had tended to induce a spirit of liberalism and
opposition to monarchy in the New World.
It was not long before Chile was caught in
the same whirl as the rest of the Spanish-American
provinces.</p>

<p>The approach of the end of almost three
centuries of the colonial system in Chile does
not speak well for Spain. Trade was still
restricted. The post-office was a monopoly that
had been farmed out to a private person. A
mail vessel arrived at Montevideo from Spain
once in two months, and from there the mails
were transported across the Andes. There was
a post once a month between Concepción and
Santiago, and twice a week between Santiago
and Valparaiso. Most people used private couriers
or travellers for their despatches. The
only manufactures were the making of brandy
and wine, drying beef and tanning hides.</p>

<p>No city, except Santiago, had more than six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
thousand people, and that city had perhaps
thirty thousand. Horse racing, cock-fighting,
bull-fighting and cards were the only amusements.
The buildings were creditable, but the
streets were dirty, unlighted, and unsanitary.
People who went abroad at night had their
servants carry lanterns before them. Vice and
disorder was everywhere. Robbery, brawls
and assassination were frequent. Begging
was an intolerable curse. Titles of nobility
were common, and had been purchased by
many unworthy persons. Decorations of
membership in orders of nobility had been
scattered broadcast. There was not even a
school for girls in Santiago. The majority of
the people still lived in the country in homes
that were without conveniences. They had little
furniture, but all were provided with an oratorio
in which each wandering missionary was
expected to celebrate mass. The Indians were
held in practical slavery, and the landlords
administered justice over their tenants. A
sentimental attachment, and also fear that a
bad condition might be made worse, kept these
poor humans from leaving. Diseases often became
epidemic through the unsanitary conditions,
so that thousands were at times swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
away. Concepción lost a fourth of its population
one year through the ravages of smallpox.
It is probable that at the beginning of the nineteenth
century the total population of Chile,
exclusive of the Araucanian Indians, did not
exceed a half million.</p>

<p>There are two men by the name of O’Higgins
prominent in Chilean history. The first,
Ambrosio O’Higgins, was born in Ireland in
1730, of humble parentage. His uncle, a
Spanish priest, sent the youth to South
America, and he finally landed in Chile. He
first became a trader and peddler, and then
an engineer. During this latter employment
he built the <i>casuchas</i>, as the rest houses in the
Uspallata pass are called. He also distinguished
himself in fights with the Indians, so
that he received government recognition. Plain
Ambrose became Don Ambrosio. Then the
Irish youth, once a ragged, barefooted urchin,
became successively Marquis of Osorno, governor
of Chile, and, finally, Viceroy of Peru.
He died at the age of eighty, in Peru, while he
was filling the latter office. His administration
was marked by indefatigable activity. It was
not until he was sixty-eight years of age that
he became captain-general of Chile, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
position he held for eight years. He introduced
a number of agricultural reforms and set aside
many of the abuses on the plantations. He
constructed a passable road between Valparaiso
and the capitol, where none had hitherto been
built, as the Spaniards were content to ride
on mules and carry their goods the same way.
He improved the road over the Andes via the
Uspallata pass, as trade by this route had
greatly increased. Altogether the things accomplished
by this energetic Irishman were
remarkable; his efforts and talents worked a
great deal of good for Chile and Peru. Had
all the governors and viceroys been men of
similar character history would probably read
differently.</p>

<p>The year 1810 was fraught with direful consequences
for Spain. In that year Hidalgo
sounded the <i>grito</i> of independence in Mexico,
and the memorable assembly met in Buenos
Aires, which was the forerunner of a successful
revolution. The news of the latter event,
which happened on the 25th of May, soon
reached Santiago and fanned the fires of revolution.
On the 18th of September three hundred
and fifty electors met in that city and
elected a <i>junta</i> to take charge of the government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
A quiet submission to the new order of
things followed for a few months. A Congress
was elected and opened with solemn religious
ceremonies and many eloquent speeches. But
jealousies soon arose over the personnel of
the government <i>junta</i>, and several years of conflict
with Spain and internal dissension followed.
The leaders of the patriot forces were
Bernardo O’Higgins, of Irish descent, Lord
Cochrane, an Englishman, and San Martin, an
Argentinian. The disturbing element was contributed
in the main by three brothers, named
Carrera. Though leaders for a while these
brothers, of whom José Miguel Carrera was
the ablest one, all met violent deaths at the
hands of their indignant countrymen.</p>

<p class="caption">JOSÉ DE SAN MARTIN.</p>
</div>

<p>Bernardo O’Higgins was born in Chillan,
Chile, in 1776, an illegitimate son of Ambrosio
O’Higgins. He was educated in England,
where he imbibed republican sentiments. He
returned to Chile a few years before his
father’s death, and immediately identified himself
with the revolutionists. By the year 1813
he was at the head of their forces. He proved
to be a man of wonderful activity, although
not of military training. Troubles between the
Carreras and O’Higgins were unfortunate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the patriot cause, but the latter was in the
right and the jealousies of the former thwarted
him at every turn. After several years of
possession of the capitol by the revolutionists
the loyalist forces under General Osorio recaptured
Santiago, and O’Higgins was compelled
to flee. The general fled to Mendoza and
there joined General San Martin, who was
greatly impressed by the Irishman. For several
years the destinies of these two men were
linked and intertwined.</p>

<p>José de San Martin was a noble character,
and his life was actuated by unselfish principles.
There was, according to the best accounts, a
moral grandeur in his character, which places
him in the rank of the world’s great leaders
and patriots. No doubt he had his faults, which
may have been serious enough, but his life was
far above his contemporaries, and he has
given us a sample of self abnegation which is
well worth remembering. He gave his sword
to the best interests of the human race, and
when he found that his presence might not serve
the cause of humanity in the nations he had
liberated, he went into exile and poverty.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Here is a pen picture of San Martin written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
by one who interviewed him at Lima: “On
the 25th of June I had an interview with
General San Martin on board a little schooner
anchored in Callao Roads. There was little
at first sight in his appearance to engage attention,
but when he arose and began to speak
his great superiority over every other person
I have seen in South America was sufficiently
apparent. He received us in a very simple
style on the deck of his vessel, dressed in a
surtout coat and a large fur cap, seated at a
table made of a few loose planks laid along
the top of two empty casks. Upon this occasion
his views and feelings were decidedly stated.
‘The contest in Peru,’ said he ‘is not a war
of conquest and culture, but entirely of opinion.
It is a war of new and liberal principles against
prejudices, bigotry and tyranny. I do not
want military recognition; I have no ambition
to become conqueror of Peru; I want
solely to liberate the country from oppression.’”</p>

<p>In 1822 San Martin decided that he wanted
to meet Bolivar. A meeting was arranged between
the two to take place at Guayaquil, on
the coast of Ecuador. Bolivar had driven the
Spaniards from Venezuela, Colombia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Ecuador, but had not proceeded farther south.
San Martin wished to cooperate with him in
the subjugation of Peru. Bolivar came to the
city with some fifteen hundred men, and entered
the city under arches of triumph. San Martin
arrived by sea on a little vessel called the
Macedonia. He landed and passed through
files of soldiers who had been drawn up to
do him honour. When the two heroes met
they embraced, entered the house arm in arm
and were left alone. What actually occurred
no one knows, as neither of the principals ever
revealed the conversation. It is known, however,
from subsequent events, that San Martin
decided upon self abnegation, which, he believed,
would be best for the cause of liberty.
A great ball was given to the two heroes, which
was preceded by a banquet. Bolivar loved
these festive occasions, but San Martin avoided
them whenever possible.</p>

<p>After his return to Peru San Martin wrote
to Bolivar as follows: “My decision is irrevocable.
I have convened the Congress of
Peru; the day after its meeting I shall leave
for Chile, believing that my presence is the
only obstacle that keeps you from going to Peru
with your army.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon his resigning his office San Martin
delivered a speech, of which the following is
a part. “I have witnessed the declaration of
independence of the states of Chile and Peru.
I hold in my possession the standard which
Pizarro brought to enslave the empire of the
Incas. I have ceased to be a public man. Thus
I am more than rewarded for ten years spent
in revolution and warfare. My promises to the
countries in which I warred are fulfilled—to
make them independent and leave to their
will the elections of the governments. The
presence of a fortunate soldier, however disinterested
he may be, is dangerous to newly
constituted states. I am also disgusted with
hearing that I wish to make myself a sovereign.
Nevertheless, I shall always be ready to make
the last sacrifice for the liberty of the country,
but in the class of the private individual, and
no other. With respect to my public conduct,
my compatriots (as is generally the case) will
be divided in their opinions. Their children
will pronounce the true verdict. Peruvians!
I leave your national representation established.
If you impose implicit confidence in
it, you will triumph. If not, anarchy will
swallow you up. May success preside over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
your destinies, and may they be crowned with
felicity and peace!”</p>

<p>There were at least five great battles that
decided the liberty of South America. One
of the greatest of these was that of Maipo,
or Maipu, which was fought on Chilean soil.
Although this battle lasted only a few hours,
it was the result of years of careful preparation
by San Martin. In 1814 San Martin, who was
then in Buenos Aires, decided that the best
way to free Argentina was to drive the
Spaniards from the West Coast, as that was
the principal seat of their power. He accordingly
sought the governorship of the province
of Cuyo, which bordered on Chile, and repaired
there to begin his real preparation. The <i>junta</i>,
that governed Buenos Aires, gave him a small
body of troops, which San Martin had already
drilled and made effective soldiers. To these
were added Chilean exiles, slaves who had been
freed, and others whom he could gather at
Mendoza, in the foothills of the Andes, which
was his capitol. For two years he trained
these men, gathered his artillery and ammunition
and made his preparation to cross the
passes of the Andes. No detail had been
omitted by this careful organizer. To no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
did he reveal his plans until he was ready for
the start, then his army, which numbered about
four thousand, was divided into two bodies,
which proceeded through different passes
across the border into Chile. More than seven
thousand mules had been collected for the
soldiers to ride, and every mule was shod.
Specially designed sledges had been constructed
on which to carry the guns. Jerked beef,
parched corn and other supplies had been prepared
for food in large quantities.</p>

<p>The lonely and desolate passes of the mountains
suddenly disgorged a well-equipped and
disciplined army on Chilean soil. The royalist
forces were taken by surprise, although reports
had from time to time reached the commander.
General Maroto concentrated his forces on the
ridge of Chacabuco, whose yellowish-brown
hills are almost devoid of vegetation. There
was no definite road over this ridge, which consisted
of an intricate complexity of steep-sided
little valleys, or barrancas. General San
Martin divided his forces, the command of one
section being given to O’Higgins. Both sections
attacked the Spanish forces vigorously, and the
latter soon gave way through the very force
of the onslaught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>O’Higgins formed his infantry in a solid
column, and with drums beating, advanced
against the enemy’s front. The men were
greatly fatigued by their march, and the sun
was beating down fiercely. After a slight repulse
O’Higgins and his infantry made a bayonet
charge. The shock was terrible, and the
Spanish lines first wavered and then broke and
ran. The defeat was decisive for the royalist
forces. The Spaniards left two-thirds of their
number on the field of battle or in the hands
of the victors. The loss of San Martin was
insignificant, for his casualties did not exceed
one hundred and fifty. The Spanish governor
abandoned Santiago that same night, and
General San Martin and his army entered it
two days later, on the 14th of February, 1817,
in triumph.</p>

<p>When the army reached Santiago a popular
assembly was convened. The dictatorship was
offered to San Martin, but he declined.
O’Higgins was then selected and accepted.
The country, however, was in a deplorable
condition. The new dictator exiled a bishop
and many priests, shut up traitorous women
in convents and began vigorous measures to
preserve order. But the war was not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
over. Several sanguinary engagements followed.</p>

<p>General Osorio landed with an army at
Talcahuano and slowly proceeded northward.
San Martin and O’Higgins endeavoured to entice
him as far as the river Maule, after the
country had been thoroughly devastated. General
Osorio made an unexpected night attack at
Cancha-Rayada and inflicted a terrible defeat
on the patriotic forces. San Martin retreated
in good order, and took up his position along
a ridge of low hills about two miles from
Santiago. Osorio established himself on a
similar ridge. Between the two forces was a
plain about half a mile in width. On this
plain was fought the battle of Maipo on the
5th of April, 1818.</p>

<p>The day was exquisitely beautiful, and the
sky was clear and serene. San Martin opened
with a strong artillery fire from both his right
and left flank. He then ordered a general advance.
The horse grenadiers, who had accompanied
him from Argentina, charged the
Spanish lines furiously. Other battalions
charged the royalist right, which was made up
of veterans of the Peninsular wars. The
Spanish cavalry were driven from the field. San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Martin brought his reserves into action and
the Spaniards began an orderly retreat. They
withdrew to the buildings and walled enclosures
of a <i>hacienda</i>. These were soon broken down
by the patriot guns. The closing scenes were
horrible. The infuriated patriots showed no
mercy, and the <i>patios</i> and gardens were soon
littered with the dead. The result, after several
hours of fierce fighting, was of a most
decisive character. The Spaniards’ loss was
nearly three thousand. The remainder were
flying in every direction, with the enemy in close
pursuit. Osorio finally reached Talcahuano
with only ten men, the remnant of the original
force of five thousand that entered the battle
of Maipo. The revolutionists’ loss was eight
hundred killed and one thousand wounded.
Spain at last realized the strength of her
opposition.</p>

<p>The war for liberty now turns toward Peru.
Soon after the decisive battle of Maipo San
Martin reverted to his original plan to invade
Peru. The <i>junta</i> at Buenos Aires commanded
him to return to Argentina and aid them in
that city. But he refused to be drawn into
the local struggle between the different factions
that were seeking to obtain control of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
government. He began work on his new expedition
with the same careful and methodical
plans to gather about him an effective army
as he had at Mendoza. The survivors of that
army were loyal to their commander, and they
willingly volunteered for this new enterprise.
Others were added, and all were carefully
drilled. Supplies and ammunition were
gathered. It was not until 1820, however, that
San Martin was ready to embark for Peru with
an army of four thousand one hundred men.
This force was conveyed to the Peruvian
coast by the Chilean navy under command of
Lord Cochrane, who played an important part
in driving the Spaniards from this coast and
liberating Chile and Peru from their domination.</p>

<p>The name of Lord Cochrane is an honoured
one in Chile, and the visitor will find numerous
monuments and memorials to that British
soldier of fortune. Thomas Cochrane was the
tenth Earl of Dundonald, and was born in
Armsfield, Scotland, on the 14th of December,
1775. He became a member of the House
of Commons, and was an officer in the royal
navy. One writer says of him: “He was,
after the death of Nelson, the most notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
naval commander in that age of glory.” He
had made a reputation for himself as a daring
officer during the Peninsular War. In 1814
he was accused of spreading a report of the
death of Napoleon, and was fined, and expelled
from the navy and Commons. He was also
sentenced to a year in prison, which he served.</p>

<p>Angered and embittered by what he considered
the unjust treatment of his country,
Lord Cochrane accepted a commission from
the revolutionary party of Chile to take charge
of their little navy. He arrived in that country
on the 28th of November, 1818. For the construction
and equipment of this little fleet
ladies had given their jewels, and even church
plate had been contributed. He arrived in time
to cooperate with San Martin in the movement
that was then being formulated for the advance
against the Spaniards in Peru. Maipo
had already been won. With four little vessels
conveying the transports Cochrane started for
Callao and arrived there safely. The Spanish
gunboats were anchored under the protection
of the batteries on shore. A terrific fire was
opened on the <i>O’Higgins</i>, which was the flagship,
as the other boats were not able to
get within range because of a calm. Cochrane’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
enthusiasm was caught by the crew, and they
successfully withstood the onslaught of several
hundred guns. The <i>Esmeralda</i>, the best ship
of the Spaniards, was captured by strategy.
Cochrane always led his men in person, and
was ever in the midst of the greatest danger.
His courage and recklessness soon won for the
doughty admiral the name of “El Diablo.” He
declared and maintained a blockade of the entire
Peruvian coast. He used fire-ships which
scattered terror amongst the enemy. His
vigorous tactics made his name feared by the
Spaniards and Peruvians, so that the battle
was half won before it was begun. And yet
his crews and officers would be generally considered
unsatisfactory, for they were composed
for the most part of adventurers. He captured
Valdivia by a clever ruse, which was the
strongest fortified place on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Cochrane had the misfortune of a bad temper,
and quarrelled with nearly every one in
authority. He could not understand San
Martin’s deliberation in attacking Peru, so that
these two men, both able and honest, could not
work together. He quarrelled with O’Higgins
and others. He drove the Spanish fleet off
the Pacific waters from Guayaquil south. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
cleared the waters of pirates, and to him in
great part was due the emancipation of Chile
and Peru—all of this in two and one-half
years. Cochrane finally left Chile and commanded
the Brazilian navy from 1823-5, which
position he resigned because of charges of insubordination.
He then went to Greece and
commanded their army for two years. Finally
his good name was cleared in England and he
returned to his native country, and had achieved
the high rank of rear-admiral in the British
navy when he died at the ripe old age of
eighty-five.</p>

<p>The victory of Maipo, although won at great
loss, forever settled the Spanish power in Chile.
Absolute independence from Spain was at once
proclaimed. O’Higgins managed to introduce
a few reforms, but the country was still lawless,
disturbed and unsettled. Armed bands of
robbers, calling themselves royalists, attacked
haciendas and villages, and murdered travellers.
The dictator did the best he could and
introduced many reforms in procedure. Even
these improvements seemed to bring discontent.
He was always optimistic, which was not
for the best. Some men in whom he placed
confidence betrayed it. The priests were insidious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in their preaching, as they favoured the
royalty. The Indians were incited to rebellion
whenever possible.</p>

<p>Traitors arose among the malcontents. Others
were jealous of O’Higgins. San Martin
and Lord Cochrane were both appointed to
head the opposition, but each declined. One
General Freire consented. An assembly was
convened, which the dictator attended. After
a stormy scene O’Higgins resigned his office
rather than plunge the country into civil war.
The withdrawal of his firm but kindly hand
was a great loss to Chile. He went to Peru,
where he died an exile at Lima in 1842.</p>

<p>The long struggle with Spain had accustomed
the Chileans to military service, and the
control of the country naturally fell into the
hands of the military element. Once the common
danger disappeared, intrigue and personal
ambition ran riot and led to a condition of
affairs bordering on anarchy. Chile, however,
never acquired the revolutionary habit to such
an extent as its neighbours, for there was a
powerful landed aristocracy whose interests
lay in the cultivation of the soil, for which
peace was necessary. Anarchy lasted only for
a few years, and then followed four decades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
during which time four successive presidents
ruled the country for two terms of five years
each.</p>

<p>After the resignation of O’Higgins, in January,
1823, Congress offered the dictatorship
to General Freire, who was then marching
against the capital with a considerable force.
A constitution was promulgated, but it proved
to be only so much waste paper, for Freire
soon suspended it. He quarrelled with the
Church authorities, banished the Bishop of
Santiago and issued decrees confiscating ecclesiastical
property. Congress was dissolved. A
new election was ordered, but only a few members
were chosen. Political confusion followed,
but another Congress was elected that limited
the dictator’s powers. He maintained his position
only by the use of sheer force.</p>

<p>In 1826 Freire succeeded in driving the
Spaniards from the island of Chiloé, which was
their last stronghold. This victory temporarily
strengthened his prestige somewhat,
although the liberals were daily becoming
stronger. A financial crisis was impending as
the expenses exceeded the revenues. Freire
was temporarily replaced by Manuel Blanco
Encalada. But things became worse and Freire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was recalled. This restoration lasted only a
few months when he resigned in favour of General
Pinto. Pinto succeeded for a while in
suppressing the disturbances, and endeavoured
to introduce some reforms in the army and
finances. A new Congress wrestled with the
constitutional problem. Rivalries among the
leaders were too much for him. It was too
easy for the aristocratic landlords to get up an
army from among their peons, or inquilinos.
A whole series of presidents and dictators followed
in the next couple of years. Social as
well as political anarchy reigned supreme.
Disorders were prevalent, robberies occurred
daily and life was unsafe.</p>

<p>Order was gradually coming out of chaos,
however, for peace began to appear above the
political horizon. With the battle of Lircay
the conservatives, under General Prieto and
Bulnes, won a decisive victory over the other
elements. Freire fled and a horrible slaughter
followed, for the victors were merciless. Freire
himself and his partisans were banished to
Peru, and his sympathizers removed from the
army.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus42">
<img src="images/illus42.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CONGRESS PALACE, SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>At the election in 1831, General Don Joaquin
Prieto was chosen chief magistrate. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
he owed his elevation to the military power,
the new President did not attempt the role of
dictator at first. He was ably seconded by his
chief cabinet officer, Señor Portales, one of the
ablest statesmen that Chile has produced.
After two years of careful preparation a
new constitution was promulgated in 1833.
Although it has been amended from time to
time to meet new conditions, just as has our
own constitution, this instrument has remained
the fundamental law of the land. It gave to
Chile a strong and stable government. The
foundation of the government, under the franchise
conditions, was the property-holding
class. Political power originated in an oligarchy
which obtained control of Congress.
Although such a possibility was not designed
in the constitution, it gradually developed a
government by dictators. This was due to the
turbulent character of the people. Extraordinary
powers were granted from time to time
in order to suppress revolutionary outbreaks.
These powers included the right to suspend
the constitutional guarantees, to imprison and
exile political suspects without trial, and to
adopt such other arbitrary measures as the
executive might deem advisable. All of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
powers were invoked by President Prieto before
the end of his first term.</p>

<p>As there was no constitutional inhibition
against a second term Prieto was reelected in
1836, and Portales retained his portfolio. All
branches of the government had been reformed
over the former chaotic conditions, and industrial
progress had been rapid. The credit of
the country was good, and interest was paid
promptly. Life in the new republic, however,
was not dull. It was sometimes necessary to
put down disorders with a firm hand. Opponents
were banished without mercy. Peru
seemed to have favoured those who sought
refuge on her soil, and war was declared
against that republic. Several battles were
fought, and Chile captured the entire Peruvian
navy, consisting of three vessels. Portales was
killed, and a serious repulse finally compelled
Prieto to make peace. This caused trouble at
home, and it gave Prieto’s enemies a chance to
denounce the war and its outcome. A new expedition
was sent against Peru under General
Bulnes, and this expedition was successful.
The Bolivian-Peruvian dictator was overwhelmingly
defeated, and this success made
Chile the dominant power on the Pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Coast, a position which it has retained ever
since.</p>

<p>At the election in 1841 General Manuel
Bulnes was chosen president. He was a very
distinguished soldier. Owing to his training
as a soldier, President Bulnes had little idea
of any method of administration other than by
force. His course toward political opponents
was severe, and all attempts to dispute his
authority were crushed with an iron hand.
Nevertheless, during the ten years administration
of Bulnes, prosperity made great strides
and Chile became a nation of influence and
importance. The growth of the customs revenues
placed the government finances on a
sound footing. The President fostered education
and other reforms. A more liberal religious
atmosphere began to grow up. Mines
were discovered and opened. The Liberals
began to be more numerous, but Bulnes was
outspoken in his opposition to them. In spite
of their opposition he succeeded in selecting
Manuel Montt as his own successor in 1851.</p>

<p>The new President was a civilian and had
been a member of the Supreme Court, and
many reforms were expected from him. More
would probably have been granted by him, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
his standing was of the highest, had not a
serious disturbance broken out just a few days
after his inauguration. The headquarters of
the revolutionists were at Concepción. Proceeding
toward the capital they won several
small victories. The decisive battle of Loncomilla
followed, however, in which the government
was victorious, but not until five thousand
Chileans had lost their lives in this internecine
warfare. Peace and general amnesty followed
this victory, and equilibrium was quickly established.
Montt welcomed liberals among his
followers. A number of administrative reforms
were adopted, although the liberal program
was strenuously opposed. New treaties with
the leading commercial nations were negotiated.
Nevertheless the policy of centralizing
the entire government with the bureaucracy of
Santiago was followed up. Many leading liberals
were exiled. During his second term
Montt attempted to grant a greater degree of
political liberties, but insurrections broke out
in the north and south, and there was bloody
rioting in Valparaiso. This led to a renewal
of drastic measures. Montt finally came into
open rupture with Congress, because it favoured
the return of his political enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
among whom were some of the ablest men in
the republic. The clergy were angry because
they were compelled to submit their decisions to
the civil tribunals. He became more and more
dictatorial in his methods. Newspapers were
suppressed, meetings dispersed, and agitators
imprisoned. President Montt succeeded in
putting down the various insurrections. In
spite of defeat on the field of battle the liberals
in fact won a victory, for their cause was forced
on the government. It was obliged to make
some concessions in order to prevent a renewal
of the conflict. The government was in this
condition when Montt’s second term reached
an end in 1861.</p>

<p>José Joaquin Perez, a man of high personal
prestige, was unanimously chosen as Montt’s
successor. From the very commencement of
his administration Chile began to enjoy a freedom
unknown in the preceding thirty years.
Criticism of the government was encouraged,
instead of being treated as a crime to be punished
by imprisonment or banishment. The
policy of President Perez was one of conciliation,
in order to unite the discordant elements.
A law was at once passed granting amnesty to
political offenders. The extraordinary powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
heretofore granted to dictatorial presidents
was not even asked for by Perez, nor did he
need it. Railroads were opened up, and colonists
began to come in. Fierce parliamentary
struggles over certain reform measures followed
in Congress, and there were many
changes of ministry.</p>

<p>The only serious disturbance of the Perez
administration was a brief war with Spain,
which occurred in 1864-5. The dispute was
primarily between Spain and Peru, but Chile
took the part of the latter, for fear that Spain
might seek to reestablish her authority in
South America. As a result Valparaiso was
blockaded by the Spaniards and bombarded.
Millions of dollars worth of property were
destroyed in a few hours, but the Chileans
would not yield and grant the apology demanded.
Public feeling ran very high for a
few months. Chile had only one war-ship, but
this boat captured a Spanish gunboat. This so
humiliated the Spanish commander, Admiral
Pareja, that he suicided. Although the war
did not officially end for many years, nothing
hostile was done by Spain after the bombardment
of Valparaiso. Perez was reelected as a
matter of course in 1866, and finished his second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
term. Pressure for amendments to the
constitution had become very strong, for the
foreign influences were becoming noticeable.
A measure was passed forbidding a president
to be reelected to succeed himself, and this
marks an important step in the evolution of
political ideals. A desperate effort was made
to enfranchise all who could read and write.
This measure, although favoured by Perez, was
defeated, but the property qualification was
greatly reduced. In every way the two administrations
of President Perez marked the beginning
of a new era in Chilean affairs. The
rights of the people began to receive greater
consideration from politicians.</p>

<p>The election of 1871 was hotly contested.
The liberals were very aggressive. The conservatives
united with the moderates, and
Federico Errázuriz, an astute politician, was
chosen. This election practically marks the
elimination of the conservatives as an important
element for several presidential terms.
It was not long after this election until more
radical elements controlled Congress, and
Errázuriz sided with the liberals in their program
of reforms. The great issue was the
amenability of the clergy to the civil law. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
anti-clerical party forced through this law, and
made concessions to Protestant worship. The
requirement of obligatory teaching of the Catholic
religion in the public schools was greatly
modified. The Archbishop promptly excommunicated
all who voted for these laws, and the
breach between the liberals and clericals was
further widened. The administration of President
Errázuriz was marked by considerable
internal improvement and the beginning of a
greater navy, which was soon to be very useful.
Political reforms went forward with increasing
momentum, but not without the usual results.
As soon as the liberals had things in their
power, the various factions into which they
were divided began to intrigue among themselves
for congressional majorities. Material
prosperity had continued until the great world
panic of 1873. The government customs fell
and financial troubles followed, but the debt
was successfully refunded. One of the most
remarkable features of this administration was
that the same Prime Minister held his office
during the entire term of four years without
interruption.</p>

<p>The election of 1876 brought out several
candidates. In former years the retiring President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
had practically selected his successor.
More liberal ideas now prevailed, and the Chileans
were called upon to decide for themselves
who should be their chief magistrate. There
were three active candidates, among whom was
Señor Anibal Pinto, who was nominated by the
moderates and elected. President Pinto was a
man of studious habits and a strong advocate
of peaceful measures. And yet this man of
peace was called upon to preside over the
nation during one of its most severe trials.
Never did he falter, even when war became
necessary, and never did he waver in his determination
to protect Chilean interests.</p>

<p>The dispute with Argentina over the southern
boundary had by this time become acute.
Public feeling in both republics had reached
such a stage that peace was threatened. A
previous treaty had declared that the boundary
should be the same as in colonial times. This
was hazy and uncertain, because that section
had been and still was uninhabited. No one
had ever been concerned about it. Chile had
always claimed the Andes to the east and Cape
Horn to the south. Punta Arenas had been
founded thirty-five years previously without
serious opposition from Argentina. For years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
this controversy continued between the two
countries, but impending war with Peru hastened
a treaty. The territorial limitations
were finally decided upon and Chile practically
got all that she had contended for. Chile obtained
practical control of both ends of the
Straits, although the channel was declared
neutral and neither nation can erect any fortifications
along it.</p>

<p>A severe economic crisis, due to the depression
in the mining industry, also disturbed this
administration, but this situation was met as
well as it could be. But all the troubles of
President Pinto pale before the sanguinary war
conducted against the combined forces of Peru
and Bolivia, in which the lives of twenty thousand
of his subjects were sacrificed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NITRATE WAR</span></h2>

<p>The early Spaniards were very little interested
in geography, and the boundaries between
the provinces were often very vaguely
described. Since the independence of the
various provinces these boundary lines have
been the cause of many disputes, and, in many
instances, have nearly plunged neighbouring
republics into bloody war. The most serious
dispute still unsettled is between Peru and
Ecuador, which involves a large part of the
territory of the latter republic.</p>

<p>The older readers will remember that, when
they studied geography, Bolivia had a stretch
of sea coast along the desert of Atacama. For
a considerable time after independence was
secured little attention was paid to Atacama,
since it was regarded as worthless for colonization.
Chile claimed sovereignty, and its
jurisdiction was generally recognized. The
year 1840 brought a change. In that year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the wealth of fertilizer along that coast began
to be exploited. Disputes soon arose
between Chile and Bolivia as to the boundary
line. The various claims made by Bolivia
were inconsistent. War threatened, and diplomatic
relations between the two countries
were broken off. The outbreak of hostilities
between Spain and Peru united the two
countries against what they considered a common
enemy. A treaty was drawn up in 1866 by
which the 24th degree of south latitude was
agreed upon as the actual boundary, although
the Chileans were allowed to continue their
operations in the nitrate regions beyond that
line. Furthermore, Chile was to pay over to
Bolivia half the customs received between the
24th and 25th degrees, and Bolivia was to hand
over to Chile half the customs received between
the 23rd and 24th degrees, south latitude. It
was also provided that neither party to the
treaty could alienate its rights to a foreign
government.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus43">
<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DIGGING NITRATE.</p>
</div>

<p>This treaty gave rise to continual disputes.
Chile regarded this settlement as a final solution
of the dispute, but Bolivia refused or
neglected to live up to her part of the agreement.
By a later treaty Chile renounced her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
claims between these two degrees, with the
agreement on the part of Bolivia that the export
duties on mineral products from that zone
should not be increased, and that Chilean industries
and citizens should not be subjected
to higher taxes than then prevailed. This
treaty was to remain in force for twenty-five
years. The capital invested in that zone was
almost exclusively Chilean, and the labourers
employed were also of that nationality. Peru
had large interests in the nitrate industry and
began to intrigue with Bolivia, in order to prevent
a ruinous competition in the market. So
long as Chilean enterprise was left free this
monopoly was impossible. As the interests of
Peru and Bolivia were opposed to those of
Chile, these two republics, in 1872, entered into
a secret treaty of alliance. Like many state
secrets this one became public, and Chile began
to prepare for a conflict, which seemed impending,
by purchasing ironclads and in other
ways strengthening her navy.</p>

<p>In 1870 a revolution occurred in Bolivia, and
a new government came into power which refused
to carry out the provisions of the last
treaty entered into with Chile. It, furthermore,
at the alleged suggestion of Peru, attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to increase the taxes upon all nitrate
exports, in absolute violation of its treaty
obligations. The manager of a Chilean company
was imprisoned, and the property was
confiscated on his refusal to pay the enhanced
tax. Chile issued an ultimatum through her
diplomatic representative. Upon the refusal
of the Bolivian government to recede, Chile
landed troops at Antofagasta and took possession
of that city. Bolivia declared war against
Chile on the 1st of March, 1879, and, because
Peru refused to abrogate the secret treaty
between it and Bolivia, Chile declared war
against Peru the following month. Most writers
lay the blame for the war entirely upon the
aggressiveness and covetousness of Chile, but
a careful study of the situation shows great
moderation on the part of Chile for a long
period of time.</p>

<p>It was generally believed that the Peruvian
navy was far superior to that of Chile, but,
as a matter of fact, they were pretty evenly
matched. For several years Chile had steadily
strengthened her naval forces. Peru had
suffered from internal dissensions and corrupt
administrations, and was ill prepared for war.
Bolivia was in still worse condition. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
time of the outbreak of hostilities the only
available arms were fifteen hundred Remington
rifles, and the stock of ammunition was small;
the rest of the army was equipped with old
flint-lock muskets. The bulk of both the Peruvian
and Bolivian armies were Indians. The
Chilean army was not large at the time of the
declaration of war, but its personnel, man for
man, was far superior to either of its adversaries.
The Chileans were likewise prompt
and energetic in their preparations for war.
The land forces were increased, and both naval
and army supplies were accumulated at strategic
points. Because of the long stretch of sea
coast it was inevitable that the navies of the
two countries would bear the brunt of the
fighting, as subsequent events proved.</p>

<p>The naval war was opened with the blockade
of Iquique by the Chileans. With Iquique as
a rendezvous the Chilean navy visited various
ports, and inflicted serious damage to commercial
interests. The aim was to deprive
Peru of her main source of revenue. Peru had
an intrepid and doughty admiral by the name
of Grau, who commanded the Peruvian fleet,
of which the <i>Huascar</i> was the flagship. While
the main part of the Chilean navy was away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
from Iquique, two Peruvian boats appeared in
that harbour. The <i>Huascar</i> rammed and sank
the <i>Esmeralda</i>, one of the best of the Chilean
ships, after four hours of heavy firing. It
was at this fight that Arturo Prat, who was in
command of the <i>Esmeralda</i>, made a hero of
himself by leaping upon the deck of the
<i>Huascar</i>. “Follow me,” said this brave
officer, as he boarded the <i>Huascar</i>, sword in
hand. The ships, however, separated so
quickly that only one man was able to follow
him. Prat rushed along the deck of the ship
as though he himself had captured it. “Surrender,
Captain,” said Admiral Grau, “we
wish to save the life of a hero.” Prat refused,
and was soon cut down while still fighting with
his sword. The <i>Esmeralda</i> sank with colours
flying, and only fifty out of a crew of two
hundred were saved. Before the conflict ended,
however, Peru also lost one vessel, the <i>Independencia</i>,
which ran upon the rocks while
pursuing the Chilean <i>Covadonga</i>.</p>

<p>For four months Admiral Grau traversed
the Pacific coast from Arica to Valparaiso.
He prevented the transport of the Chilean
army northward. Discontent grew rapidly.
The Chileans decided that they could do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
until they rid themselves of this doughty
seaman. Their navy was divided into two
squadrons, both of which began patrolling the
coast. The <i>Huascar</i> was accompanied by the
Bolivian <i>Union</i>. These two vessels were cruising
together near Antofagasta on October 8th,
1879. When the mist, which had been thick,
lifted, they made out three distinct clouds of
smoke toward the northeast. These were soon
recognized as one of the Chilean squadrons.
Admiral Grau fled, but soon ran into the other
squadron approaching him from the direction
in which he was fleeing. The Admiral at once
decided that the only thing to do was to close
with the <i>Cochrane</i> before the other boats could
come up, and steamed straight for that boat.
None of the shots of either boat were effective
until they were in close quarters, when a chance
shot disabled the <i>Huascar’s</i> turret. Grau tried
to ram the <i>Cochrane</i>, but the latter was too
quick for her. By this time the Chilean <i>Blanco</i>
had come up and added her shots to those of
her sister boat. A shot struck the conning-tower,
in which the Admiral was stationed, and
blew that commander into atoms. A little later
the second officer, and then the next one in
seniority, were killed, which demoralized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Peruvian crew. One-third of the officers and
men had been either killed or wounded when
the vessel was finally surrendered. This fight
is interesting not only because it was one of
the deciding events of the war, but it was the
first fight between modern ironclads. The
entire engagement lasted but little over an
hour. After repairs the <i>Huascar</i> was incorporated
into the Chilean navy.</p>

<p>The capture of the <i>Huascar</i> gave the Chileans
the absolute command of the sea, and
enabled them to land an army wherever they
pleased along the coast. Nor did the Chileans
delay their onward march. A Chilean army
of ten thousand men, well-equipped, had been
landed at Antofagasta, and other regiments
were in Valparaiso ready to embark as occasion
arose. On the 28th of October this army
was embarked on fifteen transports convoyed
by four men-of-war. The destination was kept
a profound secret, but a few days later they
steamed into the harbour of Pisagua. A small
force of Bolivians defended this port, but they
were unable to prevent the landing of the Chilean
troops. A brief skirmish ensued but the
Bolivians were soon in retreat. The allied
forces of Peruvians and Bolivians had an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of some nineteen thousand men at Iquique.
These men were marched out to meet the invaders.
The march of these forces across the
desert regions was difficult because of the lack
of provisions, and especially the scant supply
of water, from which the troops greatly suffered
in many instances. The Chileans had
established themselves at Dolores and San
Francisco, where there was an abundant supply
of fresh water.</p>

<p>The majority of the allied armies were Inca
and Aymara Indians. They had generally been
recruited by force. Villages would be surrounded,
and all the men that could be caught
were impressed into the ranks. They were
generally obedient and brave, and were capable
of enduring hunger, thirst and fatigue such
as would have overwhelmed white troops.
They were unequalled in their capacity to make
long marches with scant supplies of food and
water. In no other way could the Chileans
have been withstood. The wives of many
accompanied them. These women are called
<i>rabonas</i>, and were regularly recognized. As
soon as a halt was made these women immediately
busied themselves in preparing the food.
After the battles they ministered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
wounded. Callous to all danger hundreds of
these faithful helpmates met death on the field
of carnage.</p>

<p>The first battle occurred at San Francisco
and Porvenir. The vanguard of the allies was
made up of Indians from the Lake Titicaca
district. They were led by the brave Colonel
Espinar. As these forces led a charge against
the Chilean guns a bullet pierced his forehead,
and he fell mortally wounded. A cry of grief
and horror fell from his countrymen and their
courage failed. Disputing every inch of ground
they fell back to the main body of troops. The
battle so gallantly fought resulted in a decisive
victory for the Chileans.</p>

<p>General Buendia, commander of the allied
forces, retreated to the village of Tarapacá,
which was a collection of mud huts. It is situated
in a narrow but fertile valley not to exceed
six hundred yards in width, and he there
awaited the attack which he knew was soon to
follow. With practically no cavalry and a
dozen antiquated field-guns the prospect was
not alluring. The odds seemed hopeless. He
was not kept long in suspense. A force under
Colonel Arteaga consisting of picked men,
cavalry and artillery soon appeared. The aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
was the complete destruction of the allied
army. For this purpose the force had been
divided into three divisions.</p>

<p>A mist hung over the little valley while the
Peruvian army rested with stacked arms. Suddenly
a muleteer galloped up to the commander
and reported the enemy approaching. Then
two others reported the other divisions. It
looked as though they were being surrounded
and caught in a trap. Then came the call to
arms. The men responded and advanced up
the bluffs against a withering fire. The stoical
Indians saw their leaders fall, but they set
their teeth and continued the advance. The
Chileans at last found their equals. The allied
forces were embarrassed by a lack of artillery,
but fought desperately. Many were the deeds
of heroism of that day. After a few hours of
fighting they captured some guns from the
enemy and used them to good advantage. The
result of the battle was a decided victory for
the allies, their only real victory of the war
on land. San Francisco was atoned for, and
the loss of the <i>Huascar</i> avenged. The total
loss was twelve hundred men, about equally
divided. The allies nevertheless retreated
across the desert to Tacna, as it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to maintain an army in the interior and
they were not strong enough to recapture
Iquique. In this way General Buendia saved
the flower of his army. In several battles of
this campaign several thousand troops were
lost on each side, but, as a result, the Chileans
came into control of all of the nitrate country.
Several months later Tacna was captured, and,
with the battle of Arica, which has heretofore
been described, all of present-day Chile was in
control of the victors.</p>

<p>The disasters to the armies of the allies
caused revolutions in both Peru and Bolivia,
and the President of each of those countries
fled to Europe. Armed revolts arose and
fighting took place in the streets of Lima.
The position of Peru was desperate. With her
navy destroyed Peru could no longer defend
herself against the aggressions of the enemy
on the sea. The Chileans blockaded Callao,
and a marauding expedition under Captain
Lynch bombarded a number of coast towns.
Captain Lynch had been ordered to ravage the
whole coast north of Callao, and he executed
his instructions to the letter, destroying government
and private property in every direction.
Several Chilean boats were sunk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
harbour of Callao through ingenious schemes
of the Peruvians. On one occasion the Chileans
saw a boat loaded with fresh provisions. They
began to transfer these supplies to the <i>Loa</i>.
As the last of the cargo was being hoisted
aboard, a terrific explosion occurred that sank
the <i>Loa</i>. It was no doubt due to an infernal
machine that had been placed in the bottom.
The <i>Covadonga</i> was destroyed by a similar explosion
on a small boat captured in the harbour
by the Chileans.</p>

<p>The United States offered its mediation in
October, 1880, and commissioners of the
three countries met on board the corvette
<i>Lackawanna</i> of the United States navy, in the
harbour of Arica. The first meeting took place
on the 22nd of October, when the American
minister took the chair and announced the purpose
of the convention. He added that the
American representatives would take no part
in the discussion, but would be glad to help
with friendly suggestions. The Chilean commissioners
presented a memorandum of their
demands, which was in substance what was
eventually granted, but the Peruvians refused
such hard terms, thinking that foreign intervention
would save them. Chile absolutely refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
arbitration or a full war indemnity, and
the convention broke up without any progress
having been made towards peace.</p>

<p>The delay of a few months in the progress
of the war had enraged the volatile Chileans,
and those in charge of the war finally decided
that it would be necessary to capture Lima.
An expeditionary force of thirty thousand
men of all arms was organized, transports
were purchased and the resources of the country
were taxed to the utmost to carry on this
expedition. The army was formed into three
divisions, one of which, under Captain Patrick
Lynch, was ordered to land at Pisco. A second
division was instructed to disembark at Curayaco
Bay, which was one hundred miles nearer
the capital than Pisco. The first division was
ordered to march by land northward to join
the second division in the final attack upon
the capital.</p>

<p>At Lima all was confusion as the news of
the actual advance of the Chileans towards the
capital reached that city. “The City of the
Kings,” as Pizarro had named it, the wealthy
and prosperous capital of modern Peru, was
now threatened with all the horrors of war.
The population of the city at that time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
been estimated at one hundred thousand souls,
of whom at least fifteen thousand were foreigners.
The inhabitants were pleasure-loving,
and there was a very large irresponsible element,
composed in part of negroes and Indians,
that meant trouble in those dark days. The
flower of the Peruvian army had been destroyed.
Thousands rested on the deserts of
Tarapacá, and the sand hills of Tacna and
Arica. Those seasoned troops that were in
the city had become more or less disorganized.
A decree was issued ordering every male resident
in Lima between the ages of sixteen and
sixty, of whatever trade, profession and calling,
to join the army. Gay and thoughtless
youths, students, idlers and the vicious were
all brought together in the ranks under this
order. It is easy to make such decrees, but
a decree does not make an army. It takes
months to create an efficient fighting force.
However brave these Peruvians might be, they
were not trained in military service, and they
lacked the qualities of the seasoned soldiers of
the Chilean army. From three to six in the
afternoon all business was suspended by Presidential
decree, and these drafted troops were
drilled. The call to arms was made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
tolling of the bell in the great cathedral. The
artillery was inferior, and it could not compete
with the Krupp and Armstrong guns with
which the invaders were provided.</p>

<p>Nicolas de Pierola, who was at the head of
the army, with the title of Supreme Chief,
realized the danger, and strove in the best way
possible to prepare for it. At a meeting of
all the generals and naval officers, plans were
evolved to protect the city. As soon as it
became known that the invading army had
landed to the south of Lima the preparations
were devoted to protecting the city from that
direction. As the time was short it was not
possible to prepare extensive fortifications. A
chain of sandhills, which ran through Chorrillos,
about ten miles from the city to the
south, was chosen as the first line of defense.
These hills formed a sort of natural barrier,
and breastworks were thrown up at various
places along them, and these newly-recruited
and hastily-drilled troops were stationed along
this first line of defense, which was at least
six miles long. A second line of defense just
outside Miraflores, and four miles nearer the
capital, was established, and thousands of these
troops were stationed there. The time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
too short to create very formidable fortifications.</p>

<p>The first division of the Chilean army landed
at Pisco on the 13th of December, and immediately
began its march overland. Villages
and plantations were destroyed along the route,
and the record of Captain Lynch is a rather
cruel one. On the 25th a junction of the two
divisions was made at Curayaco. These two
bodies proceeded to Lurin, a small village lying
in a beautiful little valley, and remained there
about three weeks, while making their final
preparations for the capture of the capital.
This time was spent in reconnoitering and collecting
provisions for the final campaign. The
Chilean army at this time consisted of an
effective force of twenty-six thousand men,
with seventy long range field guns, and a considerable
body of cavalry. Most of these
troops were thoroughly disciplined men, who
had had experience in previous campaigns.
They were under the command of General
Baquedano, who had made a record for himself
in this war.</p>

<p>The battle of Chorrillos began at dawn on
the morning of the 13th of January, 1881.
The Peruvians were taken by surprise, but resisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
bravely. It was not long, however, until
their right flank was driven back, and then
various other points of defense were carried
at the point of the bayonet. The Chilean cavalry
completed the victory by pursuing and
cutting down fugitives in every direction, until
the plains for several miles were covered with
the dead bodies of the Peruvians. The Peruvians
fell back in more or less disorder to the
second line of defense, which was only six
miles distant from the city itself. An armistice
was arranged by the diplomatic corps at
Lima on the 15th, in the hope of preventing
any more bloodshed and averting the horrors
of a battle just outside the capital. This was
done at the request of the Peruvian commander-in-chief,
and the Chilean general agreed
that it should last until midnight of the 15th.
Through some misunderstanding some shots
were exchanged, and each party believed that
the other had violated its agreement, so that
the battle of Miraflores was fought on that
date. The defense of the Peruvians was brave,
as they were fighting for their homes and the
city which all of them loved. The battle extended
over the entire line of the second defense,
which was not less than four miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
The battle began early in the afternoon, and
a number of warships in the harbour near there
assisted in the assault by firing their long
range guns. The ammunition of the defenders
ran low and the defense began to weaken.
The Chileans made a bayonet charge, and one
breastwork after another was captured. For
almost four hours the defense was maintained,
but at the end of that time the Chileans were
victors. The village of Miraflores was burned;
the pleasant country homes surrounding it
were sacked, the crops destroyed and the work
of devastation was terrible. On the 16th, Lima
was surrendered to the Chilean general by the
Municipal Alcalde, and possession was to be
given on the following day. The intervening
night was a night of terror, and, had it not
been for the voluntary service of the foreign
colony, the whole city might have been sacked
by the disorderly elements in it.</p>

<p>The Chilean commander entered Lima on the
16th and established himself in the palace. He
immediately took possession of the revenues,
policed the city, and endeavoured to restore
peaceful conditions to such an extent as they
could be under a military government by a
hated foe. A million pesos a month was levied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
upon the citizens, and they were required to
meet it. The conduct of the Chileans was reprehensible
in that they became vandals. A
great part of the valuable library, filled with
almost priceless volumes, was looted and some
of it sold as junk on the streets. Pictures and
statues were removed and taken to Chile, where
they may still be seen. The Chileans, coming
from the same stock and claiming allegiance to
the same church, did not seem to have any consideration
for a fallen foe.</p>

<p>Before a treaty could be entered into it was
necessary to have a government established
with which to treat. Several attempts were
made, but no one could be found who dared
sign a treaty that would permanently alienate
a portion of the country. The Chileans refused
to treat with Pierola, so that he resigned.
Calderon assumed the presidency, but the congress
refused him authority to alienate any
territory. Admiral Montero next attempted
the seemingly impossible and failed. At length
General Iglesias called a convention of his
compatriots in the northern districts, and it
was decided to adopt measures that would
secure the speedy retirement of the Chileans,
no matter at what sacrifice. He declared himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
President, and his pretensions were supported
by the Chileans. A treaty was arranged
with Chile, which was signed provisionally
on the 23rd of October, 1883, and is
known as the Treaty of Ancon. Five days
later the Peruvian flag was again hoisted in
Lima, and the Chileans left the country. It
was a number of years later before a treaty
of peace was arranged with Bolivia, although
no further fighting took place.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the last word has
not yet been spoken in the nitrate controversy
between Chile and Peru. The feeling of Peruvians
toward their late foe is intensely bitter.
They all look forward to another day of war,
and predict that Peru will retake from Chile
all that she has lost. If some ambitious leader
should arise in Peru and secure the presidency,
another war might easily follow. At the present
time Peru’s finances would not warrant
such a step. It is to be hoped that both nations
will seriously consider the ultimate consequences
of war, and make unnecessary the
reference of mooted questions to the arbitrament
of the field of battle.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">CIVIL WAR AND ITS RESULTS</span></h2>

<p>The successful conclusion of the war with
Peru and Bolivia began a new era in Chile.
The control of the nitrate fields meant an immense
revenue for the government, and everyone
wanted a chance to reap some profit.
Politics absorbed the public attention, and the
holding of office became the most popular occupation.
Material prosperity followed. The
Chileans believed themselves invincible on land
and sea. With outside troubles settled for the
time being internal dissensions arose, and the
fight between the clergy and the anti-clericals
broke out with renewed energy. The time
seemed ripe for the settlement of disturbing
questions arising out of the union of church
and state.</p>

<p>A new presidential election became necessary
soon after the capture of Lima, and while the
victorious troops were still in possession of
that city. Through the influence of President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Pinto, Don Domingo Santa Maria (which, in
English, means Sunday Saint Mary) was
chosen as his successor. The opposition tried
to centre on General Baquedano, the popular
hero of the recent war, but the prestige of the
government was too powerful. He was a liberal
and had been banished for his opinions
by President Montt. The conservatives by
this time were in a great minority. Santa
Maria was bitterly opposed to clerical influence
in political affairs, and this led to bitter opposition
from that quarter. The President proclaimed
that the time had come for absolute
liberty of conscience, civil marriage and the
secularization of the cemeteries. Heretofore
the priests alone had charge of the registers
of births, deaths and marriages, were alone
able to perform marriages, and in the cemeteries
only those baptized into the Roman
Catholic church were permitted interment in
consecrated ground. All other political questions
were held in abeyance during this controversy,
and feeling became intense. The
President was obliged to use all his official
prestige in order to secure a majority in Congress,
but he succeeded in passing a law requiring
civil marriage, freeing the cemeteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and establishing a special official for the registration
of births, deaths and marriages.
These were, indeed, valuable reforms, and
reflect credit on the administration of Santa
Maria. Serious disorders resulted as the 1886
election approached, in which several persons
lost their lives. Several men had the presidential
bee in their bonnets and were backed
by an active following. Nevertheless, in spite
of all opposition, Santa Maria’s chief cabinet
officer, and the man who had been most active
in carrying out his program, Balmaceda, was
chosen to succeed his chief, through the active
aid of the administration and its official influence.</p>

<p>Since the close of the war with Peru, the
most noted name in Chilean history is that of
José Manuel Balmaceda. He was inaugurated
President on the 18th of September, 1886, and
his term was destined to be marked by stirring
events. This man was, as a contemporary
describes him, “about fifty years of age, six
feet in height, of spare build and broad sloping
forehead, with a good, humourous eye and
wears generally on his face a half-playful, half-cynical
smile.” His opponents call him a
tyrant, a usurper and a dictator, but historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
generally credit him with being a man far
ahead of his time.</p>

<p>The first position of prominence held by
Balmaceda, except as a member of Congress,
was in the cabinet of President Santa Maria.
Educated for the priesthood, he had been saved
from that career by the opposition of his
father, and later he became one of the most
radical opponents of the Church, and one of
the leaders in the fight for the separation of
Church and State, which had been carried on
during the term of his predecessor. He had
been one of the most active and influential
advocates of the radical programs of the
<i>reformistas</i>. At the time of Balmaceda’s election
the country was divided into no less than
six different parties, ranging from the fiercest
radicals to the most conservative churchmen.
The civil marriage law, which had been inaugurated
during the term of Santa Maria, as
well as some other anti-church legislation, had
aroused the opposition of all the clergy. The
priests went so far as to refuse to perform
a religious ceremony for any one who had
been married by civil officers, and had even
excommunicated the President and his cabinet
who supported that measure. The women, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
were especially under the domination of the
priests, used all of their influence in opposition
to the new marriage law. Nevertheless, with
all of this opposition, ladies’ entreaties and
priests’ absolution could not prevent the election
of Balmaceda, who was chosen by a coalition
of the radical elements, even though they
were somewhat loosely cohered.</p>

<p>Balmaceda took the reins of government at
an exceedingly unfortunate period. I have
already had occasion to state the predominating
influence of Congress in the government,
and the possibilities it gave for an obstinate
Congress to embarrass the President. It had
become one of the unwritten laws that the
resignation of a ministry should follow an
adverse vote on any measure. In other words
a ministry could only hold office when it represented
a majority in Congress. As no power
was given the President to dissolve that body
when an adverse majority existed, so that an
appeal might be made to the country, the
President was greatly hampered. The last
year of Santa Maria’s administration had
brought about a serious condition of affairs.
Violent scenes were enacted in Congress in the
fight between the supporters of the President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and his opponents. The revenue and appropriation
bills had expired, and a filibuster on
the part of the opposition had prevented new
ones from being enacted.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that Balmaceda was
inaugurated. He faced the situation courageously,
and proceeded to collect the taxes and
pay the expenses in accordance with the provisions
of the expired law. This situation was
accepted by the country, for a prosperity had
fallen upon Chile such as the country had never
known. In spite of reckless expenditures the
revenues from the nitrate fields, which had
been taken from Peru, mounted up so rapidly
that the surplus soon reached immense sums.
Mining industries of all kinds were exceedingly
flourishing. Balmaceda, who was both clever
and capable, as well as sincere, entered upon
a campaign to educate the people, and no less
than fifteen hundred public schools were established
by him. Hospitals, health offices, fire
brigades and other progressive institutions
were aided liberally. Many public works, including
railways and colonization schemes,
were fostered, salaries were raised, and the
Araucanian Indians were admitted as citizens
of the republic. New election laws were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
passed, which had for their purpose the development
of real democratic government.</p>

<p>Nevertheless beneath the outward prosperity
a smouldering fire was burning. The slogan
of Balmaceda “Chile for the Chileans”
aroused the opposition of foreign interests.
The reduction of ecclesiastical fees and stipends,
and the enforcement of the civil marriage
law, kept the opposition of the clergy
alive. The jealousy of the old families, who
had heretofore been supreme in the government,
to the new democratic measures advocated
by Balmaceda were aroused. Furthermore
the election of Balmaceda was really not
by a party, but the result of a temporary coalition
of three discordant elements. By 1889
Balmaceda had succeeded in arousing the
enmity of practically all the parties. The progressive
elements had split into nationals,
liberals, dissentient-liberals and radicals. Continual
changes in his cabinet followed, and one
group was substituted for another every
few months. It had been the ambition of
Balmaceda to unite all the liberal elements
into one party, but in this he had signally
failed.</p>

<p>Balmaceda soon found himself without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
majority in Congress, and with no prospect of
securing one. Heretofore a majority had sometimes
been acquired by the trading of votes
among the different factions in exchange for
a share of patronage. Even this method no
longer availed. The idea gradually became
prevalent that the President was plotting to
build up a strong personal following, in order
to establish a dictatorship and replace with it
the power of Congress. Circumstances, as
much as anything else, practically forced
Balmaceda into this position. He believed in
himself and his own motives, and the selfishness
of the different liberal groups irritated
him. All of this turmoil was galling to a man
of the character of Balmaceda. Reformation
of various evils was his aim, but he found himself
thwarted at every turn. He soon grasped
the fact that if he could control Congress, he
could settle the vexed questions which, in his
opinion, retarded the development of his country.
Furthermore, he gave a wider interpretation
to the constitution in relation to the powers
of the executive than did the legislative body.</p>

<p>Congress finally refused to pass appropriation
bills or vote supplies for the army, and,
in retaliation, Balmaceda dissolved Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
which he claimed he had a right to do under
the constitution of 1833. In January, 1890, he
appointed a cabinet composed exclusively of
personal followers, and these new ministers
announced that they would hold office so long
as they were satisfactory to the President, regardless
of Congress. A definite rupture was
inevitable, for the breach had become so wide
that temporizing was impossible. Balmaceda
must either resign or assume dictatorial powers.
He chose the latter.</p>

<p>The <i>Comision Conservada</i>, which safeguards
the interests of Congress when that body is
not in session, demanded that that body be
convoked. Balmaceda ignored the request. A
mass meeting in Santiago denounced the President.
The opposition finally became so bold
that a <i>junta</i> was formed, of which Captain
Jorge Montt, a naval officer, was the head.
The particular charges made by the revolutionists
were that the President had no right
to maintain any military forces after the
appropriations for its support were exhausted.
Balmaceda retaliated with a proclamation that
he would follow the precedent established when
he came into office, would collect taxes and
maintain the public service by executive authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
until the assembling of the next Congress.
He expressly disclaimed any intention of establishing
a dictatorship, but refused to allow
Congress to interfere with the executive functions
of the government. As neither party
would recede actual war soon followed.</p>

<p>Through the influence of Captain Montt
the entire navy, with the exception of a couple
of torpedo boats, adhered to the revolutionists.
On the night of January 6th, 1891, the Vice-President
of the Senate and the President of
the Chamber of Deputies embarked on the
<i>Blanco Encalada</i> with Captain Montt, and the
revolution was begun. A cargo of war material
designed for the government was captured
and the naval stores at Talcahuana
seized. On the 10th a skirmish occurred between
the shore batteries at Valparaiso and
some boats of the navy, and in this engagement
the first blood in this civil war was shed.
From this time events moved forward with
great rapidity. The majority of the aristocracy
espoused the cause of the revolutionists, and
this move had great influence. Although several
attempts were made to produce mutiny
among the troops they remained loyal to
Balmaceda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The disaffection of the entire navy was both
a surprise and disappointment to Balmaceda,
but he immediately placed the army on a war
footing and increased their pay. A reward
of two years pay was offered to the crew of
any man-of-war if the vessel deserted the
revolutionary cause, but this inducement had
no effect. Balmaceda placed the troops in several
parts of the country, where he thought
they would be most useful in defense. The
natural conditions of Chile, however, hindered
him. As the revolutionists had control of the
sea, it was impossible for Balmaceda to relieve
the small garrisons at Iquique, Antofagasta
and Pisagua, the nitrate ports. The revolutionists,
after a few short skirmishes, obtained
possession of these places. Pisagua fell first,
and a couple of bloody battles were fought for
its possession and then recovery. The troops
at Iquique were withdrawn to resist the land
forces, and marines were landed who captured
it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus44">
<img src="images/illus44.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MILITARY BARRACKS, SANTIAGO.</p>
</div>

<p>The congressionalists then established their
headquarters at Iquique, and took possession
of the immense revenues derived from the
export of nitrate. With this cash they purchased
the most modern arms and equipments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Balmaceda, although having means, was unable
to get modern rifles, so that his troops were
not so well armed as those of the revolutionists.
The two torpedo boats, which remained loyal
to the government succeeded in sinking the
<i>Blanco Encalada</i>, and also in doing other damage
to the navy, but not enough to cripple
its effectiveness. Blockades of the ports cut
off all of Balmaceda’s outside supplies. Balmaceda
attempted to purchase ironclads in
Europe, but the revolutionists outbid him and
he was unable to build up a navy. The long
seacoast was also a disadvantage to him, since
it was impossible for him to transport his
troops by water as the revolutionists could.
It was not many months until all the northern
provinces were under the control of the revolutionists,
but no engagements had taken place
in the central or southern provinces. The
revolutionists were encouraged by these successes,
and public opinion was undoubtedly
changing because of the high-handed and arbitrary
methods of Balmaceda. Suspected persons
were arrested, and many of them executed
without trial. The value of human life seemed
to sink into insignificance, and a reign almost of
terror followed. In one instance a guerilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
band composed of young men, some of whom
were not more than sixteen years of age, and
all belonging to the best families in Santiago,
were captured by the government force at
a farmhouse. Eight were shot at once and
the others, after a court martial, were sent
back to the place where they were captured
to be executed. This led to a storm of execration
against Balmaceda. Furthermore, he had
chosen Señor Claudio Vicuña as his successor,
and the latter was declared elected after a
farcical contest in which no opposing candidate
appeared. The congressionalists decided to
carry the war into the heart of the enemy’s
country, and a large army was embarked at
the various northern ports under their control.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August, 1891, the revolutionary
fleet of seventeen vessels suddenly appeared
at Valparaiso with the entire revolutionary
army, consisting of a little less than
ten thousand men, aboard. This force was to
oppose an army of forty thousand government
forces. The former, however, were volunteers,
while the latter was known to contain large
numbers of disaffected ones. Two days later
these troops were landed at Quinteros, not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
from Valparaiso, and near the mouth of the
Aconcagua River.</p>

<p>At this place the river flows through a flat
valley, which is from six hundred to eight
hundred yards in width, and is bordered by
lines of hills from four hundred and fifty to
six hundred feet in height. The government
forces numbering six thousand, three hundred
and twenty-two men, were located on the southern
bank of the river at Concon, where their
line was about three miles in length. They were
armed with old rifles, while the troops of the
revolutionists were provided with Mannlicher
rifles of the newest pattern. General Korner,
who was in charge of the congressists, did
not hesitate before this formidable position.
He divided his forces into three parts. One
forded the icy-cold waters of the Aconcagua at
Concon <i>bajo</i> and attacked the flank of the
enemy. The second and third brigades engaged
them from the opposite side of the river,
and then crossed the river higher up. The
ships of the navy also directed their fire
against the Balmacedists. The battle was begun
on the morning of the 21st. The government
troops ran short of ammunition and began
to give way. After four and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
hours of fighting the battle was won. Retreat
soon turned into a rout, and the defeated
forces fled in every direction. The government
loss was seventeen hundred killed and
wounded, and fifteen hundred men and all their
artillery captured. The revolutionists had only
eight hundred and sixty-nine casualties. The
result was a decided victory for Balmaceda’s
enemies.</p>

<p>Of the Balmacedist troops only two thousand
could be mustered after this disaster. But
thousands of other troops were hurried to
Valparaiso before railroad communication was
severed. A slight repulse was given the congressists
near Viña del Mar. The army then
took a wide detour in order to attack Valparaiso
from the southeast. The government
forces took possession of the heights at Placilla
and awaited the expected battle. Each army at
this time exceeded nine thousand men and were
evenly balanced. But the government forces
were disheartened, even though they occupied
an exceptionally strong position. Their cavalry
seems also to have been untrustworthy,
for they gave no intelligence of this expected
move of the enemy. No less than four hundred
cavalrymen actually deserted and joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
other army. The country through which the
congressists marched was broken, full of small
streams and marshes. Hundreds of weary
stragglers slept out under the trees. They
reached Las Cadenas on the 27th and rested
during that night. Early on the morning of
the following day they started for the Balmacedist
position on the heights, and this
seems to have been the first knowledge that
army had of the presence of the foe. The
revolutionists began the engagement with artillery
fire. The advance was stubbornly resisted,
but a bayonet charge carried an outpost. A
hand-to-hand conflict ensued until the defenders
finally threw down their arms. Generals Alcerrica
and Barbosa fought valiantly until killed.
A horrible slaughter followed and the troops
of Balmaceda fled in all directions. The casualties
on both sides were heavy. Although the
fighting only lasted four hours the government
loss in killed and wounded was three thousand,
three hundred and sixty-three, and the victors
lost eighteen hundred. That same night Valparaiso
was occupied, and a night of carousal
and lawlessness and bloodshed ensued. Houses
were set on fire, and ruffians shot at the firemen
as they attempted to put out the flames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
The soldiers and mob seem to have been entirely
beyond control. The next morning four
or five hundred dead bodies were found on
the streets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus45">
<img src="images/illus45.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CHILEAN SOLDIERS.</p>
</div>

<p>This battle was the deciding point of the
civil war. When the news reached Valparaiso,
Balmaceda realized it was useless to continue
the struggle. He decided to resign and turn
his office over to General Baquedano, a friend
of the revolutionists. He issued a proclamation
beseeching the citizens to preserve order
during the crisis, in order to prevent bloodshed
and plunder. On the 29th he turned the
office over to General Baquedano in a short
and dignified speech. That day being his
wife’s saint day, the President had invited in
several of his friends to dine. Notwithstanding
the changed conditions Balmaceda did not
recall the invitations, but acted during the
whole evening as a generous host. As soon
as his visitors had left, he walked over to the
Argentine legation and took shelter. For several
days the revolutionists believed that he
had escaped the country and fled in disguise.
No one suspected that the defeated President
was at the house of the Argentine Minister,
Mr. Uriburu, afterwards president of Argentina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
On the 18th of September, the day upon
which his legal term as president expired, the
country was shocked to hear that Balmaceda
had shot himself that morning at the home of
his friend.</p>

<p>Balmaceda feared that his friends might be
embarrassed by his presence, and he furthermore
believed that his own death would make
easier the position of those who had supported
him during the trying times of the civil war.
It is quite probable, also, that his pride could
not brook the idea of a public trial and the
humiliation necessarily attending it. To die,
also, was to pose in a sense as a martyr. “I
could escape,” he said in a letter to his brother,
“but I would never run the risk of the ridicule
any disaster to such an attempt would entail,
and which would be the beginning of vexatious
humiliation that I could not endure for myself
or my family.” It was, indeed, a tragic
end, and was done in a more or less tragical
way, as he believed that he thus offered himself
as an expiatory sacrifice. He left a message
for his friends, which might be called his
political testament, in which were these words:
“Whenever you and the friends remember
me, believe me that my spirit, full of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
tenderest love, will be amongst you.” General
Baquedano ruled the country for three days
until the revolutionary <i>junta</i> reached Santiago,
when he relinquished his authority to them. A
short time later at a special election Jorge
Montt was chosen as Balmaceda’s successor,
although Vicuña had previously been selected
by the following of the deceased executive. As
was to be expected, after such a desperate
struggle, Congress was composed of members
having a common political platform. It had
been decided that the executive should be advised
by and rule in harmony with the legislative
majority. President Montt accepted the
situation and appointed a cabinet acceptable
to the majority.</p>

<p>Confidence was soon restored and business
quickly adjusted itself. The new President
proved to be conservative and non-aggressive.
The country was in a bad financial condition,
but the nitrate revenues were large. The
Balmacedists were gradually brought under
amnesty laws, until all were finally permitted
to return to Chile. Having been a sailor
President Montt took steps to build up a
stronger navy, in order to be ready for impending
trouble with Argentina. For two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
years the new administration kept a majority,
but a new election gave the Balmacedists the
balance of power amidst the warring factions.
Montt soon began to experience the same
trouble as his predecessors. No party had a
majority, and by new combinations of factions
the dominating groups were changed. A new
cabinet became necessary every few weeks, and
no definite policy or program was possible.
On the whole this administration was very
satisfactory in view of the difficulties under
which it laboured. Agricultural and mining
depression further embarrassed his administration,
but for these no government could be
held responsible. President Montt retired from
office with the respect of all.</p>

<p>At the election in 1896 Señor Federico
Errázuriz, son of a former president of the
same name, was elected over his opponent by
a majority of one. The new congressional
elections still further complicated matters. The
liberal groups became more divided than ever.
Cabinet crises grew even more frequent, and
it was only when Congress was not in session
that a ministry could remain in power any
length of time. The result was an absolute
confusion in legislation. The most serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
foreign question was the dispute with Argentina.
Excitement in both countries ran high.
Warlike speeches were made, and the public
mind was unduly excited. Preparations were
made for the mobilization of an army of fifty
thousand men, and a declaration of war was
expected almost daily. President Errázuriz
finally took the matter upon himself and
asked that the matter be submitted to arbitration.
Argentina at last consented. The
northern part was to be decided by the
representative of the United States in Argentina,
Mr. W. I. Buchanan, and the southern
section by Queen Victoria, of England. If
Errázuriz had done nothing else during his
term of office this one act places the whole country
greatly in his debt. President Errázuriz
died just before his term of office ended, and
the duties of the office were filled by the Minister
of the Interior, Señor Zañartú, until the
inauguration of his successor.</p>

<p>Señor Jerman Riesco was chosen president
for the term beginning November 18th, 1901.
The same confusion continued during the
greater part of his term, so that much useful
legislation was rendered impossible. It was
not possible for the executive to select a cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that would be responsive to his will, but he
was obliged to take one selected for him by the
legislative body. As President Balmaceda
said: “Only in the organization of a popular
representative government with independent
and responsible powers, and easy means to
make that responsibility effective, will there be
parties of a national character, derived from
the will of the people and ensuing harmony
between the different powers of the state.”
The several presidents since Balmaceda have
realized this condition, but the serious lesson
of the civil war has prevented any radical step
being taken by the occupant of that office.</p>

<p>At the election in 1906, Pedro Montt, son
of Manuel Montt, was elected to the office of
President of Chile. President Montt had served
his country in many ways, having been a member
of Congress for a long time, had held positions
in several cabinets, and had also represented
Chile as minister to the United States.
Owing to his dark complexion Montt was once
taken for a negro in Washington and refused
admission to a hotel. He proved to be a conservative
and able president, who had at heart
the best interests of his country. On few
occasions, however, did he have the legislative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
body with him, and many of his good projects
failed. He had ability, tact and honesty of
purpose, but met the same obstacles as his
predecessors. In July, 1910, President Montt
visited the United States. He spent a few
days in this country while on his way to Europe
to secure medical attention, and was shown
numerous official courtesies. He was a spectator
of the shooting of Mayor Gaynor on
board a steamer in New York harbour. Soon
after reaching Europe President Montt was
attacked by heart failure, and died in Bremen,
Germany, on the 16th day of August, 1910.
Señor Elias Fernandez Albano, Minister of the
Interior, assumed the office of executive on the
death of President Montt. In poor health at
the time Acting-President Albano survived less
than one month after his inauguration, and
died on the 7th of September.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November, 1910, Dr. Ramon
Barros Luco was elected President of Chile,
and assumed office on the 23rd of December,
1910. Dr. Luco was born in 1835, and has
had a long and honourable career in politics.
He held the office of Minister of Finance and
Minister of the Interior under several different
administrations. He has also been President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of the Senate, and has filled numerous other
responsible positions. He now has the opportunity
to round out a long life, which has already
passed the scriptural limit, with the
highest office in the gift of his countrymen.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">PRESENT CONDITIONS AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES</span></h2>

<p>Nitrates have heretofore formed the chief
wealth of Chile, and will continue to do so
for some time in the future. But agricultural
and industrial development will eventually
overshadow all else—even the saltpetre deposits.
The great central valley will be the
chief centre of a permanent and growing
population. In this region all kinds of farming,
fruit-growing and stock-raising, flourish.
Temperate and semi-tropical products grow,
for the orange and the grape, the pear and the
apple are found side by side. It not only
grows enough for home consumption, but large
quantities of grain are exported. The raising
of live stock, especially cattle and hogs, is continually
on the increase. Agriculture in this
valley is susceptible of very great expansion.
The proprietors of the large <i>haciendas</i> are
satisfied with comparatively small returns
from their lands, and this fact retards the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
through its lack of encouragement
to the small farmer. There is no doubt that
small farms would add greatly to the production
of this fertile valley, because the effectiveness
of each acre would be increased. More
than sixty thousand acres are set out in grapes
alone. The beet root has been introduced and
is said to grow very well.</p>

<p>Then come the forest lands of the southern
provinces, which must certainly prove a source
of great natural riches in the not distant future.
Tierra del Fuego promises great things
in the way of sheep-raising. Sheep grow an
especially fine quality of silky wool there,
which brings a good price in the market. There
are already several million head of sheep in
that district.</p>

<p>Chile still has a wealth of undiscovered
mineral treasures within her boundaries. The
labour, transportation and fuel problem have
heretofore been the drawbacks, as well as
isolation from the world’s consumption. In
the northern part of the republic, at the coast
ports, coal costs almost ten dollars per ton,
a price that does not stimulate its use. In the
interior it is still higher because of the cost
of transportation. The government has enacted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
very favourable mining laws. A discoverer
of a new claim is entitled to fifteen
hectares, or about thirty-six acres. An ordinary
mining claim is only one-third as large.
No person can file more than one claim at a
time in a district, but other names are oftentimes
substituted in order to group claims together.
Development of a claim is not compulsory,
and the tax upon undeveloped claims
is very low, so that it is not a burdensome
proposition to hold a claim as long as the law
allows. Many wildcat companies have been
organized in Chile, as elsewhere, and there has
been much speculation in these stocks. It is
not difficult to interest the Latin people in any
form of gambling or speculation.</p>

<p>Chile promises great development in manufacturing.
In fact, Chile is more likely to become
a commercial nation than any republic
of South America. There are already more
than eight thousand industrial establishments
of all kinds. Tanning of leather, making of
shoes, refining of chemical products, woollen
and cotton mills, etc., are included in these.
The government policy has been one of protection
and, in some instances, of actual bounties.
Sugar refineries have thus been built up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
which refine the raw product imported from
Peru. They now grind much of their own
wheat. Some of the railway equipment used
on the national railroads is made in the country.
The roto seems to make a competent workman
in the factories. The coal mines and
prevalence of water power almost everywhere
gives Chile a great advantage over her neighbour,
Argentina, in the way of manufacturing
advantages.</p>

<p>Although the operation of the national railways
has been unprofitable, and permeated
with gross mismanagement and graft, yet the
dogged persistence with which the parallel
iron rails have been spread over the country
has been most commendable. The longitudinal
railway has been pushed little by little each
year, and sometimes at the expense of national
sacrifice. The first transandine railway is now
an accomplished fact, and another route now
occupies national attention. After the settlement
of the boundary question with Argentina,
the vast sums that had been expended annually
in preparing for war were diverted to internal
development. The beneficial results can easily
be traced in both cities and country. The fearful
earthquake of 1906 caused a severe back-set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
as the government was obliged to step in
and aid in the rebuilding of its principal port,
Valparaiso.</p>

<p class="caption">A MARKET SCENE, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>The government in Chile is rather different
from that of most of the Latin-American
countries. In form it is like unto that of the
United States; in fact, it is a government of
a few of the leading families. In theory the
President is the executive head; in practice,
that official is very much of a cipher. Absolute
powers for the executive, that prevailed
for the first half century of the republic, have
been abolished, and Congress is now the real
ruling power. Whether the country is ruled
or misruled the blame must be placed on that
body, for its authority is very broad. In it
a small group of families, generally said to be
one hundred, always predominate. Among
these will be some who have become rich
through banking or commercial development,
but most of them are landowners in families
that have been prominent for generations.
All the honours and emoluments are kept within
this small circle. To it may be added the
power of the Church, for that organization has
been most powerful in political matters. It
has been in times past simply a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
political system. In recent years the government
has insisted on the right to name the
Archbishop, and Rome has been practically
forced to concede this privilege. As a rule the
influence of the Church has been in favour of
what might be termed the reactionary element.</p>

<p>As has been stated elsewhere the President
is assisted by a body of advisors, the majority
of whom are chosen by the parliamentary
body. This has led to frequent and oftentimes
ridiculous ministerial crises. These numerous
cabinet changes embarrass an executive
in whatever policy he may be trying to
develop. But he is helpless under the theory
of parliamentary government that has grown
up. Whenever the President proposes a certain
cabinet, he is met by a counter proposition
from some group or other in the legislative
bodies. Sometimes he may gain a little
temporary majority by a coalition or fusion
of some of the groups represented in Congress.
Selfish interests or jealousies, however, soon
break the union. It is at times embarrassing
to diplomatic representatives, for no sooner
have they completed negotiations with one
cabinet official than he is succeeded by another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
No vice-president is elected, the executive
office, if vacated by death or resignation, is
filled temporarily by the Minister of the Interior,
who is usually a member either of the
Senate or House of Deputies. The Congress
will then select a new executive. A change in
this system, which would make the executive
more independent, and provision for a different
succession might work marvels. This was
the trouble with that able and progressive
President, Balmaceda. To carry out his beneficial
policies he defied Congress, and a bloody
civil war followed.</p>

<p>Politics in Chile seem very much complicated
and confused to an American. Instead of two
or three parties, the small voting population
of the country are divided into no less than
seven or eight, with other combinations under
new names appearing every year or two. At
the present time one can distinguish the following:
Conservadores, Liberales, Radicales,
Democratas, Balmacedistas, Montinos and
Liberales-Democraticos. Of these the most
extreme are probably the Radicales, who
occupy about the same position in Chile that
the Socialists do in our own country. At least
they contest for that position with the Liberales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
who claim to be the most radical of
any of the political parties in Chile.</p>

<p>The Conservadores are the old church party,
and are made up of the wealthy land owners,
and those who have grown rich in mines,
railroads, etc. This party was formerly the
strongest political organization, and ruled the
country for a long period; but, within the last
two decades, it has greatly lost its grip, and
the only way in which it cuts much of a figure
in the government is when it enters into combinations
occasionally with some of the
stronger elements. The Democratas are made
up principally of the labouring classes, who
loudly proclaim what they will do for the downtrodden
labouring man, and they are blamed
for the strikes and riots in recent years. The
Liberales-Democratas are, as the name indicates,
in a midway position between the two
parties after whom they are named.</p>

<p>The Balmacedistas are those who stand for
the things that Balmaceda stood for; that is,
for an enlarged power in the executive. This
party, it seems to me, is bound to grow because
every president is confronted with the
domination of the legislative body. The Montistos
are made up of the followers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Montt family, who have been prominent in the
country since the downfall of Balmaceda.
They include those who favour the rule of the
country by Congress.</p>

<p>Politics are no doubt more or less corrupt
in Chile, as in many other countries. In this
respect the country is neither unique nor
original. If one was to believe the statements
made in opposition press, just as if one was
to believe all such statements made in the sensational
“yellow” press of our own country,
you would think the entire government was
rotten from President down to the lower officials.
Free speech and a free press run riot
in Chile. There is an inclination to make wild
charges, and editorial writers certainly say
more than they actually mean.</p>

<p>Elections are oftentimes almost farcical.
Nominations for Congress are made very much
as with us. Candidates are named, and a
campaign is carried on by means of meetings,
placards and newspapers. Manifestos and
appeals to voters are issued by the various
candidates and their supporters. The side
that gets control of the election machinery,
however, is in a much better position than the
one that merely has the votes. They are then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
counted as the ones in charge desire, and this
method is considered proper and legitimate by
all parties. Bi-partisan boards and an Australian
ballot system are unheard of and unthought—and,
furthermore, an undesired
innovation. What is the use of having the
election machinery in your control and not
using it for your candidate? This is the
average Chilean view of the subject, and the
losers usually acquiesce more or less good
naturedly. In this respect the situation is very
similar in all the republics south of the Rio
Grande River.</p>

<p>In business deals the Chilean is about as
honest and reliable as in other countries.
Many think the Chilenos are robbers and cut-throats.
But it is not so. Those engaged in
business in the country give the Chileans a
good reputation for honesty. They are procrastinating
and slow sometimes in meeting
obligations, but they do not attempt to avoid
payment; and they are always willing to pay
current rates of interest on overdue accounts.
My personal experience in Latin countries in
that respect has been good, as I have never
lost anything whatever from thieves or purloiners
in hotels, stations or elsewhere. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
instances of the honesty of hotel servants, cab
drivers and other workers are told by foreigners,
who have been in Chile. The lottery
and bull-fight have both been abolished in
Chile, and this speaks well for another form
of honour among the Chilenos. The bull-fight
has disappeared from a number of the republics,
but Chile stands alone in prohibiting the
lottery which is one of the curses of all her
neighbours. The lottery-ticket vendor is usually
one of the first persons seen in a Latin-American
country.</p>

<p>Military service in Chile is compulsory. It
is not a crushing burden, however, for the
regular army does not exceed fifteen thousand
men. This proves that military service is not
enforced very strongly, as that number would
include only a small proportion of those subject
to duty each year. One year is supposed
to be spent with the colours, after which the
conscript passes to the first reserve for nine
years, and is then included in the second reserve
until he attains the age of forty-five
years. Any child born in Chile is subject to
this service, so that foreigners sometimes
grumble. The instructors in the army are
often German officers, and the tactics are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
strictly Teutonic as well as the costumes. In
every way the German influence is noticeable.
The personnel of the army is good. The men
are hardy, active and vigorous. Their courage
has been proved on the field of battle
many times. The country is divided into five
military zones with headquarters at Santiago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus47">
<img src="images/illus47.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE BATTLESHIP “O’HIGGINS.”</p>
</div>

<p>Chile has always possessed a good navy.
The naval fleet at the present time is composed
of forty vessels, among which are nine
ironclads and protected cruisers, five gunboats
and torpedo cruisers, thirteen torpedo boats,
four destroyers, etc. The finest ship is the
<i>Esmeralda</i>, which is a boat of seven thousand
and thirty tons and capable of a speed of
twenty-one knots. She carries two 8-inch and
sixteen 6-inch guns. Then come the <i>O’Higgins</i>,
<i>Ministro Zentano</i>, <i>Chacabuco</i>, and <i>President
Errázuriz</i>—all of them protected cruisers.
The <i>Capitan Prat</i> is a battleship of six thousand
nine hundred and sixty-six tons and
twelve thousand horse-power and a nominal
speed of eighteen and three-tenths knots.
This boat was built in 1890. The cruisers
were mostly constructed from 1896 to 1898 in
British and Italian shipyards. Chile has recently
placed an order for a Dreadnaught of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the latest design, which will still further add
to the efficiency of the Chilean navy. In this
respect she is following the lead of Brazil and
Argentina.</p>

<p>The United States could and should have a
much greater proportion of Chile’s trade.
Too many manufacturers depend wholly on
business houses conducted by English or German
merchants—men who naturally prefer
the goods made by their own countrymen.
Others send representatives who are illy
adapted to deal with Chileans and other Latin
Americans. An American bank would work
wonders in developing trade. It seems strange
that American capitalists hesitate about investing
their money in such an institution. Foreign
banks established in South America have
paid good dividends. Among those in Chile are
the Anglo-South American Bank, Bank of
London and the River Plate, German Transatlantique
and the Banco Italiano. The figures
of exports and imports given below are in
themselves eloquent testimonials of the value
of Chilean trade. Branch houses in charge of
hustling Americans, or agencies placed with
American importers should be the aim of
every manufacturer who intends to push the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
trade into Chile or any of the other republics
of Latin America. At the present time there
are very few citizens of the United States resident
in Chile—probably less than five hundred
in the entire republic.</p>

<p>“Why do you not buy your steel work in
the United States?” I asked of a wealthy
Chilean gentleman who was building a large
modern block in Santiago.</p>

<p>“I wanted to do so,” he answered, “but
your manufacturers would not grant the terms
that were gladly and voluntarily offered me
in Europe. As a result, I bought all my steel
for this building, which will cost more than
a half million dollars gold, in Belgium. The
only equipment for the building made in the
United States will be a half dozen elevators.”</p>

<p>This simply illustrates one phase of the
shortsightedness of our manufacturers in dealing
with South America. The field is a large
one, and a discriminating one as well. It is
humiliating at times to an American to travel
throughout the length and breadth of South
America, and see the trade that legitimately
belongs to us slipping away to Europe, even
when some of our own factories in that particular
line are idle because of lack of orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
There has been an awakening in the past few
years, but there must still be much progress
before the American business man catches up
with the British and German in the pursuit of
the world’s trade.</p>

<p>Chilean trade has reached very respectable
figures in recent years. The total exports for
the year 1910 amounted to $115,792,811, of
which $98,234,035 were mineral exports. Of
this nitrate comprised the greatest item.
Great Britain took nearly one-half the exports;
the United States purchased $24,680,278,
slightly more than Germany, which was a decided
increase over the preceding year. The
imports amounted to $108,627,188. Great Britain
sent almost one-third of this, Germany
was second with less than one-fourth, and the
United States was third with goods valued at
$13,369,774, or about one-eighth of the whole.
Next in order came France, Argentina, Peru
and India. Spain, the mother country, furnished
less than one per cent. of the whole.
This shows a large per capita importation,
amounting to more than $30.00, which is exceeded
only by Argentina and Uruguay, and
shows a trade well worth looking after. Of
the goods imported textiles were one-fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of the whole. Mineral products, including coal,
oil products, etc., are a third, and machinery
constituted about eleven per cent. of the whole.
Machinery and petroleum products are the
principal importations from the United States.</p>

<p>The American firm of W. R. Grace &amp; Co.
occupy a prominent position in the commercial
world along the west coast of South America,
where it is the largest firm engaged in business.
Its founder, Wm. R. Grace, was born
in Ireland, but came to Peru in his youth.
After making a success in business there he
went to New York and established the head
offices of his company. He became a citizen
of the United States, and assisted the government
on several occasions. Mr. Grace became
very prominent in that metropolis. He was
twice elected mayor, and gave a very creditable
administration. Mr. Grace died in 1904. W.
R. Grace &amp; Co. took over the Oroya Railroad
in Peru and completed it. They recently constructed
the Chilean end of the Transandine
Railway, and have been engaged in many other
important public works in Chile, Peru and
Bolivia. The foundation of the fortune of
Grace &amp; Co. was guano and nitrate, and a line
of boats are run between the west coast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
New York, although flying the English flag.
Branch houses are established in the principal
cities of Chile, and an immense business is
done in importation and exportation. The
principal offices are still maintained in New
York, although one of the members of the firm
lives in London.</p>

<p>Chile’s dependence upon the sea renders
foreign trade an essential element in her prosperity.
She has a hardy seafaring population,
and thousands are employed in that occupation.
She is probably destined to have a much
larger part in the coast carrying trade in the
future. Next to the national steamers, the
British have the biggest share in the carrying
trade of Chile.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus48">
<img src="images/illus48.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TYPICAL COAST SCENE.</p>
</div>

<p>The foreign debt of Chile is in the neighbourhood
of $100,000,000, most of which is held
by the Rothschild interests. Much of this debt
was contracted during the period of military
expansion. Great quantities of paper money
were issued by various administrations, and,
as a result, the peso dropped in value. The
gold peso has a fixed value of thirty-two cents
in United States currency, and the paper peso
is worth about twenty-one cents. The gradual
drop in value of the currency has made railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
travel on the government lines and
postage the cheapest in South America. It has
also prevented much internal development.
At the present time a number of cities are
installing hydraulic electric plants, which are
very practical for this country. Several
schemes are under consideration for port developments,
of which the work at Valparaiso
will be the most important. Concepción, Talcahuano
and Corral, Iquique and Antofagasta,
will also come in for their share. Several irrigation
projects are now being constructed
which will add almost two hundred thousand
acres of irrigated land suitable for agriculture.
The electrification of the state railroad
between Valparaiso and Santiago will also
doubtless be one of the developments of the
near future.</p>

<p>The postal and telegraph systems of the
republic are good. There are more than one
thousand post offices, and the amount of mail
transported is very large. Newspapers circulate
absolutely free, and domestic postage is
lower than in the United States. Foreign
letters only cost three cents for postage.
There are more than eighteen thousand miles
of telegraph wires stretched across the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
A wireless telegraph station has been
opened at Valparaiso with a radius of eight
hundred miles, and others will be opened very
soon at other places, including the Straits district,
where the wild and undeveloped nature
of the country makes the stretching and maintenance
of overhead wires difficult.</p>

<p>Like all the South American republics Chile
is greatly in need of immigration. With such
a variety of climate it could afford congenial
homes for people from almost any country.
A few thousand of immigrants come in each
year, from three to five, but that number is
paltry. Tens of thousands could be assimilated
if they were agriculturalists. Argentina,
with her broad level acres, is too near, and
draws twice as many as all the other republics
of South America together. Wages are higher
there, too, and the Italians and Spaniards,
who comprise the greater proportion of those
seeking new homes in South America, are
drawn there. A few Boer colonies were established
in Chile after the war in the Transvaal,
but the total number was not large.</p>

<p>One unfortunate condition in Chile is the
unusually high death rate. This has been
placed as high as seventy per thousand, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
this rate would only be in exceptional instances.
It is a fact, however, that the cities
of Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepción will
frequently show a mortality rate of fifty to
the thousand of population. The average for
the whole republic is about thirty-five per
thousand, which is nearly double the death rate
for countries in the temperate zone. As Chile
is not in the torrid zone, it is not subject
to epidemics of yellow fever or other tropical
scourges. Foreigners who live there find the
climate, especially in the central part, not only
delightful, but healthful, and very old people
are quite common. The reason for this condition
of affairs is the indifference to personal
comforts and sanitation of the roto. This
leads to a frightful mortality among the children.
Occasionally there are severe epidemics
of smallpox, and the measles has caused great
ravages among children.</p>

<p>Statistics show that in some years, even with
the large birth rate among the lower classes,
the births exceed the deaths by only a few
thousands. It is a condition that demands
action by the state, for the government is
paternal in its character, and is depended on
by the people to look after these things. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
sturdiness of the roto may be due to the law
of the survival of the fittest, for only those
who possess a sound constitution reach manhood.
One who can survive the lack of comforts
and harsh conditions of life to which he
is subjected, and reach manhood, is at least
robust if not cultured or refined. There is,
indeed, much room for improvement in the
sanitary conditions of the cities in the sections
occupied by the poor, and some measures have
been taken in recent years. For the nation
it would be a good economic policy, as the decrease
in the death rate would aid in giving
the population so much needed for the development
of the country.</p>

<p>Chile dates her independence from Spain
from the 18th of September, 1810, and last
year was celebrated as her first centennial.
On this day, in the year 1910, was laid the
corner stone of a great monument in commemoration
of that event. This was participated
in by the President of Argentina and other
officials of that neighbouring republic. This
was but natural, for the soldiers of both countries
fought and bled side by side at Maipu,
Chacabuco and other places. A notable historic
parade, with the costumes and military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
characteristics of that period, was a feature of
the celebration. It represented the march of
the victorious patriot army into Santiago after
its evacuation by the Spaniards. The <i>granaderos</i>,
a military organization in Buenos
Aires which wears the same uniform as in the
time of San Martin, came over from that city
to take part. The parade halted in front of
the statue of San Martin and saluted that
noble hero. Solemn religious services and
social events made up a day that will long
be notable in the Chilean capitol. Elaborate
decorations had been erected all over the city,
and especially on the Alameda where the parades
took place.</p>

<p>Almost the entire month of September was
given up to the festivities incident to this
national centennial throughout the entire republic.
There was scarcely a town or village
that did not have its local <i>fiesta</i>. Horse races,
theatrical performances, fireworks, torchlight
processions, etc., were all included in the list
of events. A naval review was held in Valparaiso,
in which four ships of the United
States took part with those of Chile and other
nations. An industrial Exposition was held in
Valparaiso, and an Exposition of Fine Arts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Santiago. The death of President Montt and
his successor, both within a month preceding
the beginning of the festivities, cast somewhat
of a gloom upon the occasion, but it could not
mar the festal spirit in a very marked degree.</p>

<p>The relations between Chile and the United
States have, in a number of instances, been
considerably strained. As a result there was
for many years an existant prejudice against
the <i>Yanqui</i>. The first occasion arose during
the war between Peru and Chile, when the
United States offered its mediation, which
was resented by Chile because that country
desired to reap the spoils of war. Another
instance happened during the Balmaceda administration.
During his term, and the struggles
which resulted between himself and Congress,
the sympathies of the United States
were with the President. A minister sent to
the United States by the revolutionists, after
they had established a <i>junta</i> at Iquique, and
were in possession of the customs throughout
northern Chile, was refused recognition by
President Harrison. The steamship <i>Itata</i>, belonging
to the Chilean line, which at that time
ran as far as San Francisco, was seized and
held for some time because she was loaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
with arms and ammunition intended for the
revolutionists. Although the vessel escaped it
was followed by a United States cruiser and
overtaken at Iquique, where the revolutionist
<i>junta</i> turned it over to the cruiser and it was
taken back to San Francisco. This kept the
opponents of the government out of much-needed
supplies.</p>

<p>Later arose what is known as the “Baltimore
incident.” Admiral Schley, in charge of
that gun boat, had been sent to Chile to protect
American interests. He sailed freely in
and out from one port to another, and was
charged by the revolutionists with giving information
to the government party of their
movements. As the navy was all on the side
of the revolutionists, they claimed that only
in this way could the other party on land have
secured certain information. Admiral Schley
denied the accusations, and all of these charges
were afterwards proven to be false. Near the
close of that internecine struggle a number of
sailors and others from the <i>Baltimore</i> had
gone ashore at Valparaiso. While in a rather
disreputable saloon in that city an altercation
arose between some Chilean soldiers and the
party of American marines. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Chileans was knocked down, and a general
fight resulted in which the Yankees were assaulted
with clubs, knives and revolvers. One
American was killed instantly, another died
from his injuries a short time later, and a
score of others were more or less seriously
injured. In the diplomatic correspondence
which followed, an indemnity was courteously
demanded by the United States, to which an
almost insulting reply was made by Chile.
International trouble threatened for a while,
but Chile made apologies and paid the sum of
$75,000 as compensation. The matter was
then dropped, but the anti-American feeling
did not evaporate as quickly as the war-cloud.</p>

<p>Only a little over a year ago another controversy
arose through the demand made by
the State Department of the United States for
the settlement of a claim which had been in
dispute for many years. As a result much
anti-American comment appeared in the newspapers
of Chile, as though the United States
was trying to enforce a rejected claim against
a weaker nation. The visit of President Montt
to the United States, while on his way to
Europe to seek medical advice, only a few
months afterward, however, seems to presage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
that the government of Chile has buried all
difficulties and good will is again restored. It
was not necessary for President Montt to
come this way, and he undoubtedly did it in
a spirit of amity and good will.</p>

<p>A great many erroneously place strong reliance
upon the favourable effect of the Monroe
Doctrine in South America. As a matter of
fact the Monroe Doctrine at no period has
caused the sale of a dollar’s worth of merchandise
in those markets. It has, on the
other hand, through misinterpretation of its
intended beneficence, caused ill feeling, and,
perhaps, prevented the sale of American goods
in many instances. If the United States adheres
to this doctrine, the completion of the
Panama Canal will increase the responsibilities
of the United States instead of lessening
them. We, of the great North American republic,
know that the action of the United
States under this doctrine has always been
intended for the welfare of the other Americans.
Those who should feel kindly toward
us, because of it, as a matter of fact rather
resent its effect. They feel able to fight their
own battles without the aid of the powerful
republic on the North American continent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
The visit of the United States fleet a few years
ago at the various ports of South America,
and the trip made by Elihu Root, then Secretary
of State, did more to encourage a kindly
feeling toward the United States and to develop
a Pan-American spirit than anything the
United States has ever done. It now needs
only a wise and diplomatic policy to strengthen
and extend the good feeling engendered by
those events.</p>

<p>Chile, like all the west coast republics, is
becoming very much interested in the Panama
Canal, and the effect that its completion will
have upon the country. Unlike the North
American, the South American does not become
impatient over the probable date of the
completion of the canal, for it does not make
much difference to him whether it is ten years
or twenty-five years hence. The only question
in his mind is what may be the ultimate effect
of the canal. It is, perhaps, of more interest
to a North American, because the North American
is interested in the possibilities of trade
development with that coast. At the present
time there are perhaps 11,500,000 of people
living in the republics of Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia and Chile, which have a foreign commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
including both exports and imports, in
excess of $300,000,000. In addition to this
there is the trade with the Pacific coast of
Colombia. Then there is added to this the
question of the probability of future development
of those countries, which are in themselves
larger than any European kingdoms,
except Russia. The enthusiastic Chilean, for
instance, will tell you how many times larger
is his country than Holland, and estimates the
immense population that his country could
support at the same density per mile as that
little European kingdom. This, of course, is
absolutely impossible, because such large sections
of the country are untillable. Furthermore,
there never has been as yet such rapid
increases in population in any of the west
coast countries as the United States, Canada,
Argentina and Australia can show. Hence it
is not well to think of this section as being
likely to have sudden growths of population,
but there will doubtless be a slow and steady
increase in each of the countries mentioned.</p>

<p>One advantage that will accrue from the
completion of the canal will be better transportation
between all the ports of the west
coast and New York. A direct line of steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
between Valparaiso, and possibly ports farther
south, to New York is sure to be established,
for business conditions will not only
demand, but warrant such a line. By this
route the distance from New York to Valparaiso
will be only fifty-one hundred miles,
including the stops at several intervening
ports. When this distance is compared with
that from Valparaiso to Liverpool, by the way
of the Straits of Magellan, which is ninety-five
hundred miles, it shows that New York
will be several thousand miles nearer to Valparaiso
than European ports by the same
route, and the difference becomes greater as
you journey along the coast toward Panama.
If British steamers should use the Panama
Canal it would still make New York nearer to
all the ports on the west coast by almost three
thousand miles. As it is there are no boats
flying the American flag which visit Chilean
or other west coast ports, except an occasional
tramp lumber schooner which comes down
from Seattle, or a boat which comes through
the Straits of Magellan now and then from
New York for a load of nitrate. Much of the
traffic is obliged to go to Callao, Peru, and
there be transferred to another steamer to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
taken to Panama; then it is shipped by rail
across the Isthmus, and again loaded on another
steamer destined either for New York
or New Orleans.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus49">
<img src="images/illus49.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CUSTOM HOUSE, VALPARAISO.</p>
</div>

<p>It does not require an especially sharp
insight to see the advantage from a commercial
standpoint of a direct line between these
ports and New York. Furthermore, since the
completion of the Transandine Railway, and
still more so when the other route farther south
may be finished, large sections of fertile Argentina
will be nearer to the west coast than to
Buenos Aires or Bahia Blanca, on the Atlantic
coast. This would mean that shipments which
are destined for the United States from those
sections would probably be made by the steamers
using the west coast route, and through
the Panama Canal. Of course that would not
be true of grain products, for those shipments
go to Europe, as the United States has not
yet become an importer of grain, with the
exception of flax seed. We do, however, take
the greatest portion of wool, hides and certain
other products. It will tend, in the opinion
of the writer, to not only bring about closer
commercial relations, but to develop a spirit
of Pan-Americanism, which will mean a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
deal for the United States. Peru, Bolivia,
and Ecuador have been much under the influence
of American business interests, and
Chile has a natural inclination as well toward
the North Americans, but the diplomatic incidents
heretofore mentioned have made the
Chileans a little bit suspicious of the policies
of the United States. This will, however, I
believe, be entirely overcome within a very
short time. The people of Chile will then
realize that the North Americans are their
best friends.</p>

<p>The population of Chile is not large when
its possibilities are considered. It is very unevenly
distributed. The number of persons to
the square mile is less than one-half the proportion
in the United States. The pure white
population are undoubtedly in the minority.

<h3>II<br />
<span class="smaller">MOUNTAINS AND VOLCANOES</span></h3>

<p>The Coast, or Maritime range of mountains
in Chile does not present, like the Andean
range, a continuous chain, but is broken by
valleys and small plains, as well as by rivers
in their course to the ocean. The slopes of
this range are generally formed by a succession
of hills, frequently covered with vegetation,
but which rarely exceed six thousand feet in
height. In places cross ridges connect this
range with its loftier neighbouring range,
where the two systems seem to merge into one.
The three highest peaks in the Maritime range
are Cerro de Limon Verde (11,380 ft.), Cerro
de Agua Amarga (10,550 ft.) and Cerro de la
Campana de Quillota (9,325 ft.)</p>

<p>The Andean range of mountains is a succession
of high mountains with lofty peaks covered
with the everlasting snows. At intervals
passes are formed in this cordillera, which
permit access from one side to the other. The
lowest of these is that of Perez Rosales (3,230<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
ft.) in Southern Chile, and the highest is Agua
Negra (15,715 ft.). The highest point of the
Andes is Mount Aconcagua, and from there to
the south the altitude gradually decreases until
it reaches sea level at the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>The following table gives the names and
height of the principal peaks of this range of
lofty mountains according to the best estimates.</p>

<h3>III<br />
<span class="smaller">SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS</span></h3>

<p>The completion of the Panama Canal, which
is promised by 1914, will make the access to
the west coast of South America much more
convenient. Without doubt there will be established
at that time a direct line of steamers
from New York to Valparaiso, which will touch
at a number of intermediate ports between
Panama and that city. At the present time it
is necessary to take a steamer from New York,
or New Orleans, to Colon, a journey of six or
seven days, cross the isthmus by train, and
then embark on another steamer from Panama
to Valparaiso. Two lines of steamers, the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company (recently
absorbed by the Royal Mail Steam Packet
Company) and the Compañia Sud Americana
de Vapores, render this service, but sometimes
it is necessary to transship at Callao, Peru.
There is also a Peruvian line of fast steamers
to Callao. The quickest service between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Panama and Valparaiso is twelve days, and,
if one takes the slower coast steamers, the time
is longer by several days. The trip is, however,
a very interesting one and full of scenic
beauty, as well as novelty. It gives the traveller
an opportunity to get a glimpse of
Jamaica, and to see the great work of Uncle
Sam on the isthmus, which is undoubtedly the
most stupendous undertaking ever attempted
by man. Furthermore, it would be difficult to
find smoother seas over which to sail.</p>

<p>From Guayaquil, Ecuador, the traveller is
enabled to visit Quito, the capital of this equatorial
republic, which is situated at an elevation
of about 10,000 feet, and almost on the
equatorial line. One can visit Lima, capital of
Peru, and one of the most interesting cities in
South America, and can also visit La Paz,
capital of Bolivia, and the highest capital in
the world. By taking the transcontinental line
across South America to Buenos Aires, and
returning to New York by the east coast route,
one is enabled to visit the leading republics of
South America, and thus gain an adequate
idea of the entire continent. There is a very
good line of steamers from Buenos Aires to
New York, stopping at Montevideo, Uruguay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, Brazil, and
Barbados Island; or, if time is not urgent, the
traveller can return via Europe at only a
slightly increased cost. The cost of such a trip
from New York back to New York, including
all necessary expenses at sea, except gratuities,
is about five hundred dollars. This does
not cover any of the expenses on land. The
trip around the southern end of the continent
through the Straits of Magellan is most interesting,
and the scenery is magnificent. The
cost, however, is more, and the time involved
is ten days greater.</p>

<p>The language of Chile is Spanish, but, in
the cities and towns, there is very little difficulty
for one not familiar with that language
to get along without much embarrassment.
Comfortable hotels will be found in Valparaiso,
Santiago and many other cities. The prices
are rather higher than for similar accommodations
in the United States. The rates are generally
inclusive, and provide coffee and rolls
in the morning, which are generally served in
the bedroom, and two substantial meals which
are very similar in their menu. The railroad
equipment of the Chilean railroads is generally
quite good, and one will find the only real Pullman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
cars in South America. Chair cars will
be found on some of the State Railway trains,
and sleepers also in the long journeys. The
railroad fare is exceedingly cheap, and one
wonders how the service can be provided at
such a low cost.</p>

<p>The money of Chile is arranged on the same
system as our own, the standard being the
peso, which is divided into one hundred centavos
and has a value of about twenty-one
cents, but the rate of exchange varies somewhat
from day to day. Exchange is always
based on the value of the English sovereign.
The money is nearly all paper and very little
gold will be found in circulation. The price
of most articles of wear is rather high, because
of the import duties. One will notice in travelling
on the English steamers that the barber
carries a very large stock of goods, and at
each of the ports many people call on him and
purchase various articles, because his prices
are so much lower than those on shore. English
book stores will be found in the cities,
where books and magazines can be purchased.
The tariff for cab charges in all the cities is
very low and the equipment poor, but the
traveller should be sure to inform himself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the legitimate charges, or he will pay for his
experience. The cab driver of Chile is very
much like his counterpart the world over.
Street car fares are very cheap also.</p>

<p>The traveller must always remember that the
seasons south of the equator are reversed, and
that summer time in that part of the world is
the winter season in the northern climates. As
one goes south the temperature becomes cooler,
being just the reverse of conditions in northern
latitudes. The temperature also changes with
the altitude, and this fact must be borne in mind
when arrangements are being made for the
clothing to be taken on the trip. Each thousand
feet of elevation makes a very perceptible
change in the temperature.</p>
